## Overview

SmartRest is a great way to keep mobile traffic low while still being able to do all the things you can do with the Cumulocity Platform API. To get started, follow the steps below.

## Getting Started

Get your hands on a u-blox C027 preferably a REV-B model as the REV-A one does not have an LED which help with debugging.

1. Use this program as a starting point to develop your software.

1. After you have made your changes to the program, upload it to your u-blox by clicking the ‘Compile’ button and loading your program on the ‘MBED’ removable drive which is available on your computer as soon as you plug both the USB port and the power supply into the C027.

1. Press the reset button of the u-blox C027 to test the program. Optionally, you can use a serial terminal to stream the output to your computer.
