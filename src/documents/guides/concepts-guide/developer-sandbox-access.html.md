# Overview

The "sandbox" is an instance of the latest production version dedicated to testing and experimentation. It contains a public tenant that is accessible to all registered developers using the same credentials as the ones that you used to register to this web site. Note that the data in the public tenant is also public, i.e., entries that you make will be visible to other registered developers as well.

# How to log in

For accessing the administration console, type

    https://dev-dg.cumulocity.com/ui/tenantadmin/index.html

into your web browser. Click the Developer Garden icon and log in in the same way as you log in to Developer Garden. The console will open and show a short introductory text. Now you can, for example, click on "My devices" and browse the tenant's inventory, or click on "Events" and see the events, alarms and audit records. If you wish so, you can set a more user-friendly name for yourself by clicking on the user ID at the top, choosse "User Settings" and edit first name and last name.

# Using the APIs

The developer's guide and the reference guide demonstrate programmatic access to the sandbox through the APIs. Use https://dev-dg.cumulocity.com as base URL to run the examples or in command line calls.
