## EPL monitors

**Symptom: Your event processing rules are disabled automatically**

If a monitor throws an exception from `onload` or a listener and the exception is not caught, then the monitor will be terminated. Catch exceptions or avoid the reason for them occurring.

Clients could periodically run the eplMemoryProfiler management request and monitor the CSV output of this. Cumulocity monitors the memory usage and workload generated by event processing rules, as well as any errors that are occurring while running those rules. If an event processing rule consumes too much memory or generates too many errors, Cumulocity automatically disables this rule.

**Troubleshoot from having rules disabled due to memory consumption:**

Make sure that your event processing rules do not leak listeners. For example, when doing request-response operations, ensure that no listeners are left active after the response is processed.

## Number formats

Cumulocity measurements use the decimal type. When using numeric literals in your code, you must append a "d" character to use as a decimal. Alternatively, convert to float with .toFloat() (or float to decimal with float.toDecimal()). Note that the timestamps are stored as floats (seconds since 1 Jan 1970, 00:00 UTC).
