## Overview

Using the <span style="color: rgb(3,19,21);">Cumulocity real-time event processing</span>, you can add your own logic to your IoT solution. This includes data analytics logic but it is not limited to it. To define new analytics, you can use the Apama Event Processing Language - see the topic Developing Apama Applications in EPL in the [Apama documentation](http://www.apamacommunity.com/documents/10.1.0.3/apama_10.1.0.3_webhelp/apama-webhelp/) for full details. The language allows analyzing incoming data. You can create, update and delete your data in real-time.

Typical real-time analytics use cases include:

*   Remote control: Turn a device off if its temperature rises over 40 degrees.
*   Validation: Discard negative meter readings or meter readings that are lower than the previous.
*   Derived data: Calculate the volume of sales transactions per vending machine per day.
*   Aggregation: Sum up the sales of vending machines for a customer per day.
*   Notifications: Send me an email if there's a power outage in one of my machines.
*   Compression: Store location updates of all cars only once every five minutes (but still send real-time data for the car that I am looking at to the user interface).

In the following sections, we describe the basics for understanding how the Apama Event Processing Language (EPL) works and how you can create your own analytics or other server-side business logic and automation.

## Deploying EPL

You can use [Software AG Designer](http://www.apamacommunity.com/downloads/) to develop your applications. Create an Apama project in Software AG Designer and add the following connectivity bundles:

 
*   Automatic onApplicationInitialized 
*   Cumulocity IoT (Cumulocity IoT connectivity plug-in)
*   Cumulocity Utilities
*   HTTP Client - JSON with generic request/response event definitions

Also add the following standard bundle:

*   Time Format
  
The selection of the connectivity bundles in Software AG Designer should look as follows:

<img src="/guides/images/apama/connectivity_bundles.png" alt="Connectivity bundles" style="max-width: 100%">

Similarly, check the corresponding item from the standard bundles to add the "Time Format" bundle.


You will need to provide your Cumulocity credentials in the configuration files, thus in your Apama project go to config > connectivity -> CumulocityIoT and configure the credentials as follows in `CumulocityIoT.properties` file:

```
CUMULOCITY_USERNAME=user@example.com
CUMULOCITY_TENANT=exampleTenant
CUMULOCITY_PASSWORD=examplePassword
CUMULOCITY_APPKEY=apamaAppKey

```

**Info:** You need to create an application in Cumulocity to get a value for CUMULOCITY_APPKEY.  For details, refer to [Administration > Managing applications](/guides/users-guide/administration#applications).

Develop and test your EPL in Software AG Designer.

When you are ready to deploy to Cumulocity, upload the .mon file containing your application through the "Own applications" page in the Administration application. For details, refer to [Administration > Managing applications](/guides/users-guide/administration#applications). 

When EPL is deployed to Cumulocity, each .mon file is assigned a unique package name. This prevents conflicts when multiple modules are uploaded. For this reason, you should not specify a 'package' statement in the .mon files. If you need to share events between different parts of your application, then write the event definitions and monitors that use it in a single .mon file.

## Events and channels

In the Apama Event Processing Language, interactions with the rest of the Cumulocity ecosystem is done via events. A number of event definitions is provided for accessing Cumulocity data.

### Predefined event types

There are some predefined event types to interact with several Cumulocity APIs. Events are sent to Apama applications automatically when a new measurement, alarm or event is created. For interacting with the Cumulocity backend, you can create an event and send it to the relevant channel. Cumulocity will automatically execute either the database query or create the API calls necessary for sending mails, SMS, or similar.

Look at the [data model](http://www.apamacommunity.com/documents/10.2.0.1/apama_10.2.0.1_webhelp/ApamaDoc/com/apama/cumulocity/package-summary.html) to see how the events for each stream are structured.

### Sending events to a channel

Sending an event is done by constructing the event, either with `new <type>` followed by assignments to the fields, or with a constructor specifying all of the fields. The `send` statement is then used to send the event to Cumulocity. The `send` statement requires a channel - this is typically the `CHANNEL` constant (CREATE_CHANNEL for Measurement) on the event type.

### Listening to events

You can trigger your EPL by listening to events on channels. You can subscribe to channels with the monitor.subscribe(string name) method. This can be done in the startup of your monitor, or if you only need to receive events some of the time, called as needed, followed by monitor.unsubscribe(). Listen for events using the `on` statement, followed by the event type that you are listening to, open and close parentheses, and `as <identifier>` to name a variable that will hold the event. By default, a listener will fire once; to make it repeat for all events, use the `all` keyword before the event type.

## Filters

Adding filters can be done by specifying one or more fields between the parentheses for a listener. Only top-level fields can be filtered for. Use `if` statements for more complex filtering, or for filtering on sub-properties of events (for example, in dictionaries).

## Example

As an example, we create a statement. The statement listens to one event and creates a different event type whenever the specified filter applies. For instanceâ€š we want to create an alarm for each temperature measurement that is created.

**Info:** In order to create the statement, first you have to create an "EPL Monitor" in your Apama project.

1. Subscribe to Measurement.CHANNEL 
2. Listen to the measurement type - filtering on the type having the value "c8y_TemperatureMeasurement".
3.  Create the event using the constructor specifying all of the fields.
4.  Send the event to the correct channel - Alarm.CHANNEL.

The resulting monitor can look like this:

	using com.apama.cumulocity.Alarm;
	using com.apama.cumulocity.Measurement;
	
	monitor ForwardMeasurements {
		action onload() {
	    	monitor.subscribe(Measurement.CHANNEL);
			on all Measurement(type = "c8y_TemperatureMeasurement") as m {
				send Alarm("", "c8y_TemperatureAlarm", m.source, m.time,
				           "Temperature measurement was created", "ACTIVE", "CRITICAL", 1, new dictionary<string,any>) to Alarm.CHANNEL;
			}
		}
	}
