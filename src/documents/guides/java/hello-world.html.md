# Overview

This section shows two minimal examples of using Cumulocity. The first example implements a Java agent sending dummy data to Cumulocity. The second example implements a web application reading the data and showing it in a web user interface, see the screenshot. A more comprehensive example can be found in the section ["An end-to-end example"](guides/developers-guide/an-end-to-end-example).

# A "Hello, world!" agent

## Set up an agent project

Ensure that you are running the "Cumulocity runtime" platform (see the [setup instructions](guides/developers-guide/installing-the-sdk "Development environment setup 1.0")). Select "New", "Project", "Plug-in Project". Use, for example, "com.cumulocity.helloagent" as project name, check "an OSGi framework", click "Next" and "Finish". (Click "Yes" to change perspective if asked.)

The manifest editor opens up. Click on the "Dependencies" tab and use the rightmost "Add" button under "Imported Packages" to add the following dependencies.

-   com.cumulocity.rest.representation
-   com.cumulocity.rest.representation.inventory
-   com.cumulocity.sdk.client
-   com.cumulocity.sdk.client.inventory
-   org.slf4j

Save the manifest file.

## Write the agent code

Select the Activator class in src/com.cumulocity.helloagent/Activator.java. Type the following code into the "start" method, after any code auto-generated by Eclipse:

    Platform platform = new PlatformImpl("<<sandbox URL>>", "<<tenant>>", "<<user>>", "<<password>>", "<<application_key>>");InventoryApi inventory = platform.getInventoryApi();ManagedObjectRepresentation mo = new ManagedObjectRepresentation();mo.setName("Hello, world!");mo = inventory.create(mo);System.out.println("URL: " + mo.getSelf());

Replace "\<\<sandbox URL\>\>", "\<\<tenant\>\>", "\<\<user\>\>", "\<\<password\>\>" and "\<\<application\_key\>\>" with your tenant, credentials and application key. The application key is used by Cumulocity to determine what application is actually invoking its services. This way, application subscriptions can be checked. If you do not have your own tenant, you can use "demo" as the tenant and the application key "uL27no8nhvLlYmW1JIK1CA==". As credentials, use the user and password that you used to login to this site. If you logged in to this site through single sign-on, use the username and password determined during the [installation process](index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=814) ("Using OAuth Single Sign-On?"). If you want to have your own tenant, you can request it by sending an email to support. You will be provided with new credentials, tenant name and application key. You can change the "Hello, world!" text into something less worn. Right-click in the editor and select "Source", "Organize Imports".

What does this code do?

-   Line 1 connects the agent to the platform.
-   Line 2 retrieves a handle to the Cumulocity inventory.
-   Line 3 creates a new managed object.
-   Line 4 sets the display name of the new managed object.
-   Line 5 creates the managed object in the inventory. This will return the managed object back with an fresh, generated ID. (See "Object identity" section in ["Modeling and managing M2M assets"](guides/concepts-guide/modeling-and-managing-m2m-assets)).
-   Line 6 prints the URL to the new managed object that has just been stored in the inventory.

## Run the agent

Run your agent by right-clicking the "com.cumulocity.helloagent" project and select "Run as", "OSGi Framework". After a short time (whilst the agent connects to the developer server) you should see the URL of the created managed object on the console, like this (note that your URL will be different):

``` {.p1}
URL: https://developer.cumulocity.com/inventory/managedObjects/1855
```

# Improve the examples

Now that you have walked through a basic example, you can:

-   Proceed to ["Developing Java clients"](guides/developers-guide/developing-java-clients), ["Developing web clients"](guides/developers-guide/developing-web-clients) and the [reference guide](guides/reference-guide) to enhance the examples on your own.
-   Read the ["End-to-end example"](guides/developers-guide/an-end-to-end-example) for a more elaborate agent and application. This part shows also a few practical techniques, e.g., for injecting server addresses and passwords into your code.
