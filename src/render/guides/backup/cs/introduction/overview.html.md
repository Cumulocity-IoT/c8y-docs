With microservices, you can extend the Cumulocity IoT platform with customer-specific functionality. For example, you can develop integrations to 3rd-party software or provide server-side business logic. Technically, microservices are docker containers, hosted by Cumulocity. For a general introduction to microservices, see [Developing applications](/guides/concepts/applications) in the Concepts guide. 

Using Microservice SDK for C#, you can develop microservices in C#. This DeveloperÂ´s guide explains

* [General prerequisites](#general-prerequisites): What do you need to develop and run C# microservices?

* [Hello World: Run you first C# microservice](/guides/cs/hello-world-basic)

* [Developing C# microservices](/guides/cs/developing-microservice)

To get started, check the "Hello World" examples for the various C# variants.

* The most simple starting point is the [C# example](/guides/cs/hello-world-basic).

>**Info**: You can develop Cumulocity with any IDE and any build tool that you prefer, but the examples focus on  Cake (C# Make) and Visual Studio.
