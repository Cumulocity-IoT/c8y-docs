Measurements represent regularly acquired readings and statistics from sensors.

Measurements consist of a time when the measurement was taken, the unique identifiers of the source of the measurement, and a list of fragments. Here is an example of a measurement:

<pre><code class="json">{
	"time": "2011-01-02T03:04:00.000Z",
	"source": { "id": "1235", ... },
	"c8y_ThreePhaseElectricityMeasurement": {
		"A+": { "value": 435, "unit": "kWh" },
		"A-": { "value": 23, "unit": "kWh" },
		"P+": { "value": 657, "unit": "W" },
		"P-": { "value": 0, "unit": "W" },
		"A+:1": { "value": 123, "unit": "kWh" },
		"A-:1": { "value": 2, "unit": "kWh" },
		"P+:1": { "value": 56, "unit": "W" },
		"P-:1": { "value": 0, "unit": "W" },
		"A+:2": { "value": 231, "unit": "kWh" },
		"A-:2": { "value": 23, "unit": "kWh" },
		"P+:2": { "value": 516, "unit": "W" },
		"P-:2": { "value": 2, "unit": "W" },  
		...
	},
	...
}</code></pre>

Similar to the inventory model, fragments are used to identify characteristics of particular devices. In the above example, a three-phase electricity meter sends readings for the different electrical phases. Each such fragment maps the names of the individual readings ("A+", "A-", ... in this example) to the actual numeric value and the unit of measurement.

Readings can hold various additional information that applications may require. More detailed information can be found in [Measurements](/guides/reference/measurements) in the Reference guide.
