**The inventory stores devices and other assets relevant to your IoT solution. We refer to them as  *managed objects*.**


Managed objects can be "smart objects" such as smart electricity meters, home automation gateways and GPS devices. They can be the assets you would like to monitor, such as rooms in which sensors are installed, or cars containing GPS devices. 


The following JSON code shows a small example of a managed object in the inventory, in this case a simple switch.

<pre><code class="json">{
	"id": "47635",
	"type": "ge_45609",
	"c8y_Relay" : 
	{
		"relayState" : "OPEN"
	},
	...
}</code></pre>

An example for another asset stored in the inventory could be a room in which a switch is installed. (Compare the "id" property of the switch with the "managedObject" reference.)

<pre><code class="json">{
	"id": "47636",
	"type": "resortenergymgmt_Room",
	"name": "Sauna",
	"childAssets": {
		"references" : [
			{ "managedObject": { "id": "47635", ... },
			...
			} 
		]
	},
	"resortenergymgmt_RoomProperty": {
		"size": 56,
		...
	}
}</code></pre>

**In general, each managed object consists of**

* A unique identifier that references the desired object.
* A type string that defines the object type.
* A time stamp showing the last update.
* Additional *fragments*.

### Fragments

For example, you want to describe electric meters from different vendors. Depending on the make of the meter, one may have a relay and one may be able to measure a single phase or three phases. These characteristics are identified by storing fragments for each of them:

<pre><code class="json">{
	"id": "47635",
	"type": "elstermetering_AS220",
	"lastUpdated": "2010-11-13T18:28:36.000Z",
	"c8y_Position": {
		"alt": 67,
		"lng": 6.15173,
		"lat": 51.211977
	},
	"c8y_ThreePhaseElectricitySensor": {},
	"c8y_Relay": {
		"state": "CLOSED"
	}
}</code></pre>

In this example, a fragment "c8y\_ThreePhaseElectricitySensor" identifies a three phase electric meter. In addition, the device includes a relay, which can be used to turn the power supply on and off.

Using this approach, the modelling devices can make a difference between modelling  elementary sensors and controls as fragments, and modelling the entire device as a combination of sensors, controls and possibly proprietary aspects of the device.

The approach also enables developing generic application components. For example, as soon as a managed object has a position fragment ("c8y\_Position"), it can be placed on a map. As soon as it has a relay, it can be switched on and off using the respective device control command as described below.

### Naming conventions of fragments
**Fragments use a naming convention to avoid conflicts between different parties supplying fragment information, similar to Java or other programming languages.** 

In the example above, "c8y_Position" is a combination of "c8y" (a shorthand for "Cumulocity"), an underscore and "Position". Together they form a set of standard fragments. Fragment definitions can be found here [sensor library](/guides/reference/sensor-library) and in the [device management library](/guides/reference/device-management).

Note that Cumulocity follows a document-oriented approach for storing data. All characteristics of an object can be inferred from the document with the object data itself. There is no explicit separate metadata model that needs to be configured and managed. However, applications can add own metadata and store values in the inventory additionally. For example, a vending application can maintain metadata about slot configurations of the diverse vending machine types in the inventory.

### Object identification

***Each managed object in the inventory has an own, "global" identifier that is automatically generated by Cumulocity when the object is created.***

This identifier will always stay with the object regardless of network restructures or different hardware parts.

![Identity service](/guides/concepts-guide/identification.png)

***To shield applications from these numbers of identifiers, Cumulocity includes an identity service that registers all identifiers for one asset that are used outside of Cumulocity and map these to a single global identifier that is used by applications.***

This service is used by agents (to register external identifiers) and is used by business processes involving reorganisations and changes of devices (to modify maps of external identifiers to global identifiers).

As an example, assume that a smart meter would be faulty and a new meter with another meter number and asset tag needs to be installed in a household. The routine business process for replacing faulty hardware can now just update the asset tag and meter ID associated with a customer in the identity service. Afterwards both previously collected and new meter readings are related to the correct customer.

More information can be found in the reference guide for [identity](/guides/reference/identity).
