This API reference is meant to give you a complete idea of the APIs offered by the Zementis microservice in the Cumulocity platform.

The APIs use placeholders which need to be replaced with the values of your choice.

Note especially the following two placeholders:

* {{ url }} = the IP adress/domain of your Cumulocity server
* {{ auth }} = your base64-encoded tenant/username:password or username:password
