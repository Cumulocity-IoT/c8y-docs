To create the alarm, we now need two events where the first one has a distance smaller than the radius and the second one has a distance bigger than the radius. This would mean that the device just left the geofence.

		if firstPos.distance <= firstPos.maxDistance and
	   secondPos.distance > secondPos.maxDistance {
	        send Alarm("", "c8y_GeofenceAlarm", firstPos.source, currentTime,
	                   "Device moved out of circular geofence",
	                   "ACTIVE", "MAJOR", 1, new dictionary<string,any>) to Event.CHANNEL;
	}
