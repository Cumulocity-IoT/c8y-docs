As well as the predefined event types, you can define your own event types. These can be useful to detect patterns of events occurring which trigger other parts of the same module.

	event MyEvent {
		Measurement m1;
		Measurement m2;
	}
	
	...
	
	on Measurement() as m1 -> Measurement() as m2 {
		route MyEvent(m1, m2);
	}

>**Info:** Cumulocity deploys each module into its own namespace, so event definitions from one module cannot be used in other modules. This prevents dependencies between modules.
