The predictive analytics capabilities on Cumulocity IoT platform enable you to deploy and manage machine-learning models and custom resources, and use them for generating predictions on data gathered from your devices.

These capabilities can be leveraged either from a web browser via an easy to use UI (Predictive Analytics application) or programmatically via REST API (Zementis Microservice).
