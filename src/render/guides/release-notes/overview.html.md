Release notes document relevant changes included in a Cumulocity release since the previous release.

We distinguish between major releases, including new features, improvements and fixes, and simple maintenance releases with fixes only.

Major releases, also called Standard releases, are represented by for example 9.9, 9.10, 9.11.

Every 4th Standard release is a so-called Private Edition with general availability (GA), e.g. 9.12 or 9.16, which will be maintained through regular maintenance (or bug fix) releases, e.g. 9.12.6, 9.12.7, 9.12.8.  

>**Info**: From 2019 Private Editions will only be published every quarter.

Each release receives a version label "<major>.<minor>.<maintenance>[.hotfix].
