To process data from various device types, Cumulocity uses device protocols.

Click “Device protocols” in the “Device types” menu to access the “Device protocols” page.

In the “Device protocols”  page you will find a list with all device protocols available in your account.

The device protocols list shows the following information on each device:

* the device protocol type (IMPACT, LWM2M)
* the device protocol name 
* the number of resources for the device (at the right)

To add a new device protocol, click **Add device protocol** at the top bar. For details on adding a device protocol, follow the documentation of the particular device type you want to add:

* [IMPACT](/guides/images/users-guide/impact)
* LWM2M

To edit a device protocol, either click on the protocol or click the menu icon at the right of the row and in the context menu click **Edit**. 

To remove a device protocol, click **Remove** in its context menu.
