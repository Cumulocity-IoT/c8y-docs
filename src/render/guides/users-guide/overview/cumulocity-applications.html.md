Per default, Cumulocity comes with the following three standard applications:

|Application|Description|
|:---|:---|
|[Device Management](/guides/images/users-guide/device-management)|The Device Management application provides functionalities for managing and monitoring devices and enables you to control and troubleshoot devices remotely.  
|[Cockpit](/guides/images/users-guide/cockpit)|The Cockpit application provides you with options to manage and monitor  Internet of Things (IoT) assets and data from a business perspective.
|[Administration](/guides/images/users-guide/administration)|The Administration application enables account administrators to manage their users, roles, tenants, applications and business rules and lets them configure a number of settings for their account. 

Apart from these standard applications that initially come with Cumulocity, various additional applications are provided which you may subscribe to, i.e. integrated agents for several device types.

Moreover, you can add own applications to be used in your Cumulocity account. For details, refer to [Administration > Managing applications](/guides/images/users-guide/administration#applications).

The content of the Cumulocity platform therefore is entirely dynamic and is generated based on various criteria:

* The applications that your organization has subscribed to.
* The applications that your organization has configured or developed itself for Cumulocity.
* The functionality that your user is permitted to see.
* The configuration of the user interface, such as groups and reports.
