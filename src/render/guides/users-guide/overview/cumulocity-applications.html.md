Per default, Cumulocity comes with three major standard applications and several smaller built-in applications. 

On top of those, various applications are provided which you optionally may subscribe to, i.e. integrated agents for several device types.


Moreover, you can add own applications to be used in your Cumulocity account. For details, refer to [Administration > Managing applications](/guides/users-guide/administration/managing-applications).

The content of the Cumulocity platform therefore is entirely dynamic and is generated based on various criteria:

* The applications that your organization has subscribed to.
* The applications that your organization has configured or developed itself for Cumulocity.
* The functionality that your user is permitted to see.
* The configuration of the user interface, such as groups and reports.
