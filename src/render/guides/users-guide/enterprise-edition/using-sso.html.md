In order to use single sign-on feature for the enterprise tenants, the enterprise domain must be set up as redirect URI in the basic configurations.
For more details see [Single sign-on configurations](/guides/users-guide/administration#single-sign-on).

If single sign-on providers have whitelists, then the enterprise domain should be whitelisted.
