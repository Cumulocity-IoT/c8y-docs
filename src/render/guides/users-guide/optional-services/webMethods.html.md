Since 2018, webMethods Integration Cloud can be used, too, with built-in Cumulocity integration. With the launch of a common SAG Cloud platform, the integration has been further by providing e.g. single-sign login between webMethods Integration Cloud and Cumulocity IoT. 

More information on the webMethods Integration Cloud is available at [https://www.softwareag.cloud/site/product/webmethods-integration.html](https://www.softwareag.cloud/site/product/webmethods-integration.html#/).

>**Info**: Related to this, support for the Cumulocity [Zapier integration](/guides/saas-integration) will be discontinued. No new subscriptions are possible with immediate effect. Functionality for existing customers is not affected.
