The [BitBucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-examples) also contains a complete example of a server-side agent for closed devices in the folder "tracker-agent". This example works with tracking devices from Telic and Queclink, see the Section "Devices". It demonstrates solutions to various challenges when developing server-side functionality for mobile devices.
