This section gives a very basic example of using Java SE with Cumulocity through the Maven build tool. It can also be run straight from Eclipse, provided you have an Eclipse version with Maven support. Maven supported is by default included in recent versions of the [Eclipse IDE for EE Developers](http://eclipse.org/downloads/).
