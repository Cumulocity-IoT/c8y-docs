To use the Java SE client libraries, you need to have at least Version 6 of the [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) for your operating system. Some of the examples require Java 7. Java 8 is not supported and some features may not work correctly with Java 8. 
To verify the version of your Java Development Kit, type

	$ javac -version

The output needs to show a version number later than "1.6.0\_24" for the basic examples.
