This section gives an overview on how to access Cumulocity from Java clients, starting from connecting to Cumulocity over accessing data to remote control of devices. It also discusses how to extend the Cumulocity domain model from Java for new devices and other business objects. Finally, this section describes how to configure the logging service in order to control the level of diagnostic messages generated by the client.

The section is tightly linked to the design of the REST interfaces, which are described in the ["REST implementation"](/guides/reference) section of the reference guide. JavaDoc is available on the [resources site](http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/javasdk/current/).
