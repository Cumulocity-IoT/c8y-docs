The Cumulocity client library for JavaME is very lightweight and has no dependencies on other software. Its interface is very close to that of the JavaSE client library with the exception of serialization of requests and deserialization of responses into Java objects. Most of the descriptions in the other sections apply to the JavaME client library as well.

The example in this section is run on the emulator contained in the Oracle JavaME SDK. For running the code on a real device, see the section on [Cinterion Java modules](/guides/devices/cinterion). JavaME is also supported on the Raspberry Pi. We use Eclipse for the example, but a similar approach should also work in other development environments.
