The LoRaWAN by ADEUNIS RF demonstrator is a ready to use system, which provides connection to the any operated network using the LoRaWAN protocol. With 3 integrated sensors (GPS, accelerometer, temperature) this demonstrator allows to transmit and instantly view the radio frames on the compatible networks. This demonstrator is particularly suitable for the validation of applications like sensor networks, environment, intelligent buildings, metering, security, or M2M. These applications can thus be validated on site before the deployment of infrastructure. With built-in rechargeable battery, this demonstrator allows for many hours of use.

**The following data are currently recorded:**

* Raw Adeunis data as event
* Signal strength measurement including RSSI (Received signal strength indication), SNR (Signal noise ratio) and average SNR
* Battery voltage measurement
* Device temperature measurement
* Accelerometer warning  as alarm
* Button 1 triggered as event
* GPS position as event and location update
