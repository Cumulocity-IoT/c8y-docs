If you have a device which supports VNC, Telnet or SHH remote access, it's now possible to manage your device via Cumulocity starting from Agent v4.2.0.

As shown in the screenshot, you can add your VNC, Telnet or SSH servers as an endpoint with appropriate IP and port in the **Remote Access** tab of a particular device in the Device Management application. If you click **Connect**, the display content of your remote server will be shown in a new browser window.

> **Info:** The "vncproxy" package is required and must be installed.
