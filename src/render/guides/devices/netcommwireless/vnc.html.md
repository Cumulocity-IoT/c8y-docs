If you have a device which supports VNC, Telnet or SHH remote access, it's now possible to manage your device via Cumulocity starting from Agent v4.2.0.

As shown in the screenshot, you can add your VNC, Telnet or SSH servers as an endpoint with appropriate IP and port in the _Remote Access_ tab in "Device Management", then simply click on button "Connect", a new browser window will pop up, showing the display content of your remote server.
