If you have a device which supports VNC remote access, it's now possible to manage your VNC device via Cumulocity starting from Agent v4.0.0.

As shown in the screenshot, you can add your VNC server as an endpoint with appropriate IP and port in _Remote Access_ tab in "Device Management", then simply click on button "Connect", a new browser window will pop up, showing the display content of your remote VNC server.
