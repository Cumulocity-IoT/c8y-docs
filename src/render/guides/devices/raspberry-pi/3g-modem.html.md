There are [numerous descriptions available](http://www.thefanclub.co.za/how-to/how-setup-usb-3g-modem-raspberry-pi-using-usbmodeswitch-and-wvdial) for installing a 3G modem on a Raspberry Pi. An affordable 3G modem that works with Linux and that we tested with the Raspberry Pi is the Telekom Speedstick Basic (Huawei E3131).

When using a 3G modem with a Raspberry Pi Model B, a powered USB hub is required. Some modems will not read connectivity statistics concurrently to being dialed up to the Internet on the Raspberry Pi. Hence, this functionality is disabled by default in the Cumulocity Linux modem driver.
