Red Lion’s RAM® industrial cellular RTUs provide a secure all-in-one platform that offers unmatched reliability for the remote monitoring and control of field-deployed assets. With a built-in connectivity with embedded IO database, and event engine that can trigger I/O and alert via SMS text messages or email based on real-time operational data, Red
Lion’s rugged cellular RTUs provide local control regardless of location.

**Rugged Industrial Design **: Developed with industrial environments in mind, RAM cellular RTUs are enclosed in hardened metal DIN-rail or panel mount enclosures to offer a wide -40° to 75°C operating temperature range, UL Class I, Division 2 listing and high tolerance to shock and vibration.

**Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Cloud Connectivity**: Red Lion’s RAM® industrial cellular RTUs feature cloud connectivity, which allows for reliable, secure and scalable communication to leading IIoT cloud platforms.  RAMQTT, Red Lion’s native MQTT client, simplifies implementations with pre-configured profiles

**Built-In Event Engine **: With an intuitive web-based, menu-driven interface that requires no knowledge of programming languages, the RAM event engine can quickly be configured to trigger I/O or send SMS messages based on operational data. Whether a tank level is too high or a valve pressure level out of range, the RAM event engine will take
action and send SMS text message notifications to keep you in the know.

**Connectivity Options**: RAM cellular RTUs natively supporting Modbus and DNP3 protocols include built-in digital and analog I/O. Available with a split-LAN (WAN/LAN) architecture, RAM RTUs feature up to 5 10/100Base-T(X) Ethernet ports and support serial-to-IP conversions through an on-board RS-232 serial port to securely monitor remote
devices and reduce costly site visits. Red Lion also offers expansion devices for 
[protocol conversion from over 300 industrial protocols](http://www.redlion.net/products/industrial-automation/controllers-and-data-acquisition/data-acquisition), including PLC’s, drives, sensors, fieldbusses and other proprietary communication methods over different media. This enables IIoT applications for all your legacy equipment.

**Secure Networking **: Designed to deliver secure communications to remote locations, RAM cellular RTUs support robust security features such as VPN tunnels, port forwarding, stateful firewall, packet filtering, data encryption and an Access Control List (ACL).

**Powerful Management**: RAM cellular RTUs can be managed locally through direct device connection or remotely via SixView Manager® software. With a web-based console and customized dashboard, users can remotely access, configure and manage critical device
information from a central location to increase productivity and reduce overall cost.
