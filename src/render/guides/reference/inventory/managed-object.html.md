> It is recommended for property names not to start with "child" or "parent". This way you will be able to handle other types of references.

A managed object reference in the "child" and "parents" collections contains only "id", "name" and "self" properties.

Not every GET response contains "parents" collections. It is required to pass "withParents=true" query param to have "parents" included.

### GET a representation of a managed object

Response body: ManagedObject

Required role: ROLE\_INVENTORY\_READ

Example request: Get a representation of a specific manage object

    GET /inventory/managedObjects/<<deviceId>>
    Host: ...
    Authorization: Basic ...
    Accept: application/vnd.com.nsn.cumulocity.managedObject+json;=ver...

Example response:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/vnd.com.nsn.cumulocity.managedObject+json;ver=...
    Content-Length: ...
    {
      "id" : "42",
      "name" : "SomeName",
      "self" : "<<This ManagedObject URL>>",
      "type" :"com_nsn_cumulocity_example_Clazz",
      "lastUpdated": "2012-05-02T19:48:40.006+02:00",
      "com_othercompany_StrongTypedClass" : { ... },
      "childDevices": {
        "self" : "<<ManagedObjectReferenceCollection URL>>",
        "references" : [
          {
            "self" : "<<ManagedObjectReference URL>>",
            "managedObject": {
              "id": "1",
              "self" : "<<ManagedObject URL>>"
              "name": "Some Child"
            }
          },
          ...
        ]
      },
      ...
    }

### GET supported measurements of a managed object

Example request: Retrieve supported measurements of a managed object

	GET /inventory/managedObjects/<<deviceId>>/supportedMeasurements
	Host: ...
	Authorization: Basic ...

Example response:

	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	{
		"c8y_SupportedMeasurements": ["c8y_AnalogMeasurement", "c8y_MotionMeasurement", "c8y_SignalStrength", "c8y_TemperatureMeasurement"]
	}

Important: In order to have fragment names included in supported measurements list, fragment has to have specific structure:

"fragment_name" : {
	"serie_name" : {
		"value" : ...
		"unit" : ...
	}
}

Real example:

"c8y_SpeedMeasurement": {
      "Speed": { "value": 1234, "unit": "km/h" }
}

Fragment_name and serie_name can be replaced by different valid json property name, but that name cannot contain whitespaces and special characters like [],*. The structure has to be exactly as above, two-level deep json object.
