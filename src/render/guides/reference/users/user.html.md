### Device permission structure

[API:fragment_name:permission] where:

* API is one of the following values: "OPERATION", "ALARM", "AUDIT", "EVENT", "MANAGED_OBJECT", "MEASUREMENT" or "*"
* fragment name is any fragment name, e.g. "c8y_Restart" or "*"
* permission is "ADMIN", "READ" or "*"

#### Required permission per HTTP-method

+ POST - "ADMIN" or "*"
+ PUT - "ADMIN" or "*"
+ DELETE - "ADMIN" or "*"
+ GET - "READ" or "*"

"*" is a wildcard. It enables you to access every API and CRUD object regardless of fragments that are inside it.

#### Querying collections

Only objects which the user is allowed to see are returned to the user. It is possible to query next page using next link from page statistics. It is important to note that in this case the "currentPage" field represents the offset instead of the actual page number.  

>**Important: ** If an object does not have any fragment in it, then to for example read that object, you have to put a wildcard to the fragment name part of device permission, i.e. "10200":["MEASUREMENT:*:READ"].

### Audit log

Any change in user's roles, device permissions and groups creates corresponding audit records with type 'User' and activity 'User updated' with information which properties have been changed.
