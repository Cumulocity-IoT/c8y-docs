Listening to notifications through long polling generates certain traffic depending on the choice of timeouts. The table below lists the traffic generated by long polling requests with a timeout of one hour and no intervals between requests. The calculation does not include received notifications and session reconnects.

|Period|Traffic|
|:-----|:------|
|day|7 kB|
|week|50 kB|
|month|210 kB|

During handshake or connect, a client can override default server connection settings such as timeout and interval. In case of the long polling transport, a client can change the long poll request duration by passing a timeout value. Longer timeout values reduce the traffic needed for sending request and response messages but can result in a loss of the connection. Clients can also set longer interval values and wait with sending the next connect message after receiving the last response (at the expensive of less interactivity).
