### Update an Alarm

Changes to alarms will generate a new audit record. The audit record will include the username and application that triggered the update, if applicable. To get the list of audits for alarm, use the following request: GET /audit/auditRecords?source=<alarmId>

Please notice that if update actually doesn't change anything (i.e. request body contains data that is identical to already present in database), there will be no audit record added and no notifications will be sent.

Only text, status, severity and custom properties can be modified. Non-modifiable fields will be ignored when provided in request.
