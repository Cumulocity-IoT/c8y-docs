This section gives a very basic example how to create a device representation in Cumulocity and subsequently how to send related measurement data. 
All steps are performed by calling REST interfaces. 
Those REST calls are demonstrated by CURL statements that can be executed on command line. 
Please have a look on the [previous section](/guides/rest/introduction) for a short introduction to CURL.
