The sequence of REST calls demonstrated here is just a shortened procedure of [Device Integration](/guides/rest/device-integration).
The first step ('create a new device' and 'register device') is part of the 'startup phase', whereas step two ('sending measurements')
references to the 'cycle phase'.

Please go further to the [Device Integration](/guides/rest/device-integration) section to get the necessary information required for implementing
real-world agents.
