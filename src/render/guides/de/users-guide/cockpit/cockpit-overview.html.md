The data shown on the Home dashboard is shared by all users of the tenant. By default, the Home dashboard includes a welcome message, the active critical alarms, recent alarms and a map of all objects.

The Home dashboard can be edited and designed individually according to your needs. You can add, remove or change widgets being displayed here. 

For details on editing a dashboard, refer to [Working with dashboards](#dashboards).

To reset the Home dashboard to its original content, click **More...** at the right of the top menu bar and from the context menu select **Restore dashboard**.
