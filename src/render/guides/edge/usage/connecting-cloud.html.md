Cumulocity Edge provides the option to upload Edge data to a Cumulocity Cloud account selectively (note that you first need to create a Cloud account).

You can share the following data:

* devices (and more generically, managed objects)
* events
* alarms
* measurements
* operations

Navigate to "Data connectors" if you would like to send data to the Cloud account. 

Navigate to "Data subscriptions" in your cloud account to receive the data from Edge.

In the same way, you can push operations from a Cumulocity Cloud account to Edge devices.
 
For details on sending and receiving data in Cumulocity refer to [Using the Data Broker](#guides/users-guide/enterprise-edition/data-broker) in the User guide.
