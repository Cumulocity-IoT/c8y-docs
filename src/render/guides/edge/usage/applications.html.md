Cumulocity Edge comes with three built-in applications:

| &nbsp; |Application|Description|
|:---:|:---|:---|
|<i class="c8y-icon c8y-icon-device-management c8y-icon-duocolor" style="font-size: 36px;"></i>|[Device Management](/guides/users-guide/device-management)|The Device Management application provides functionalities for managing and monitoring devices and enables you to control and troubleshoot devices remotely.

|<i class="c8y-icon c8y-icon-administration c8y-icon-duocolor" style="font-size: 36px;"></i>|[Administration](/guides/users-guide/administration)|The Administration application enables account administrators to manage their users, roles, tenants, applications and business rules and lets them configure a number of settings for their account. 

Since Cumulocity Edge is based on the same software as the cloud-based Cumulocity IoT Core version, the above applications are the same in both versions, with minor restrictions. 

The following restrictions apply:

Device Management: The Device simulator is not provided in Cumulocity Edge.
Cockpit -> Cloud Fieldbus: CAN Bus and Modbus RTU are not applicable.

Refer to the relevant sections of the User guide for detailed explanation of these applications (see links above).
