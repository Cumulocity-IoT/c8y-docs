<p class="lead">In this document you will get an overview on how to develop a plugin that adds a new widget to dashboards.</p>

Before you start working on the widget plugins, we recommend you to take a look at the [introduction](/guides/web/introduction) which deals with the basic concepts of applications and plugins as well as an "Hello world!" style demo plugin.

You can find this and all the other plugins described in the documentation inside the repository [cumulocity-ui-plugin-examples](https://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-ui-plugin-examples).
