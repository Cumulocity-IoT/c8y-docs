Microservices need to understand certain details about the specific Cumulocity cluster they are running in. For example, a microservice needs to know the endpoint address of the Cumulocity REST APIs. This information is provided in environment variables. The environment variables are injected by Cumulocity when the container is started.

Refer to [Microservice container runtime reference](/guides/reference/microservice-runtime) in the Reference guide for a list of provided environment variables.
