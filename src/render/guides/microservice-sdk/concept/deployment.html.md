A microservice becomes available once it has been successfully deployed on the Cumulocity platform. This is done by uploading a zip file with the microservice package as it is specified in [Packaging](#packaging) above. A user cannot directly push an image to the docker registry.

Refer to [Microservice manifest](/guides/reference/microservice-manifest) in the Reference guide for details on how to create a manifest file with applicable settings.

For further information on deploying microservices to Cumulocity, refer to Administration > [Managing applications](/guides/users-guide/administration#managing-applications) in the User guide.

>**Info:** In case of microservices, you need to subscribe to the application to use it.
