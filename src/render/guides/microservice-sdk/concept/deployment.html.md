For a microservice to be available it has to be deployed at the Cumulocity platform. This is done by uploading a zip file with the microservice package. A user cannot directly push to the docker registry. 

For further information on deploying microservices to Cumulocity, refer to [Administration > Managing applications](/guides/users-guide/administration#managing-applications) in the User guide. 

The microservice package must contain the manifest file and docker image of the microservice.

Refer to [Microservice manifest reference](/guides/reference/microservice-manifest) in the Reference guide for details on how to create a manifest file with applicable settings.

Refer to [Packaging](/guides/microservice-sdk/concept#packaging) for details on how to prepare and deploy the microservice package.

>**Info:** In case of microservices, you need to subscribe to the application to use it.
