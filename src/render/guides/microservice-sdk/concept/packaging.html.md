A microservice has to be packed as a docker image in order to be deployed.
It requires a docker _image.tar_ and _cumulocity.json_ files packed into a zip file. For your convenience, Cumulocity provides a script.

Refer to [Microservice package](/guides/reference/microservice-package) in the Reference guide in order to prepare and deploy the microservice package.
