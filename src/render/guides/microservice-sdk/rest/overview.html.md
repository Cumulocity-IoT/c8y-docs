Cumulocity employs REST for all external communication. Regardless whether the communication originates from IoT devices, from web applications or from backoffice IT systems — the communication protocol is always REST.

REST is a very simple and secure protocol based on HTTP(S) and TCP. It is today the de-facto Internet standard supported by all networked programming environments ranging from very simple devices up to large-scale IT. One of the many books introducing REST is [RESTful Web Services](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260).

This section explains how to use Cumulocity's REST interfaces to

-   **develop applications on top of Cumulocity**.

The description is closely linked to the Reference guide, which describes each interface in detail. Relevant chapters in the reference guide are in particular

-   [REST implementation](/guides/reference/rest-implementation) is the reference for all general concepts.
-   [Device management library](/guides/reference/device-management) specifies the data model for device management.
-   [Sensor library](/guides/reference/sensor-library) specifies the data model for sensors and controls.

For further information on REST interfaces in general and on integrating devices with REST, refer to the REST section in the Device SDK guide. 

If you develop applications using Java or C#, check the relevant sections for even more convenient access to Cumulocity's functionality.
