You can define variables in your modules.

```java
string myEmailText := "Hello World";
sequence<string> supportedOperationsList := ["c8y_Restart", "c8y_Relay"];
```

If you define a monitor-scope variable (that is, inside a monitor but not within any actions on that monitor), then that can be used in a listener if you use a colon (:) instead of `as` for the event co-assignment in the listener. Thus, the example below logs the latest event every 10 seconds:

```java
monitor MyMonitor {
    // monitor scope:
    Event e;
    action onload() {
        monitor.subscribe(Measurement.CHANNEL);
        on all Event():e {}
        on all wait(10.0) {
            log e.toString();
        }
    }
} 
```
When a listener starts, it takes a copy of all of the local variables. The example below thus logs each event after a 10 second delay, even if other events come in between.

```java
monitor MyMonitor {
    // monitor scope:
    Event e;
    action onload() {
      monitor.subscribe(Measurement.CHANNEL);
      on all Event():e {
            on all wait(10.0) {
                log e.toString();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
