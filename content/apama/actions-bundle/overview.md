With Apama EPL, it is possible to utilize functions, called "actions". Every monitor will have at least one action - the `onload` action. This section covers the already built-in actions ready to use.

See also the [API Reference for EPL (ApamaDoc)]({{< link-apama-api >}}) for actions on the built-in types.
