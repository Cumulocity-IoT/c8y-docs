### Migration notes

When Cumulocity IoT is upgraded to 10.6.0, you must also upgrade the Apama-ctrl microservice from earlier versions to 10.6.0. This is mandatory due to a change in the communication protocol between Cumulocity IoT and Apama. Earlier versions of the Apama-ctrl microservice will not function correctly if running in Cumulocity IoT 10.6.0.

### Improvements in Apama EPL Apps

Some events have been added to the Apama Cumulocity IoT API to allow easy retrieval of information in some predefined areas.

- You can get the values for all the tenant options in the tenant, or search for specific tenant options.
- You can look up the details and roles of the user you connected as, or the microservice service user. Alternatively, you can forward on the `Authorization` header or OAuth cookies of an incoming request to validate the roles of that user.

In EPL, you can now receive a response for the creation or update of the predefined types (Alarm, Operation, Event, Measurement, MeasurementFragment and ManagedObject) by using the newly added `withResponse` action. Headers can now be set on the request, for example to determine the processing mode within Cumulocity IoT.

It is now possible to listen for individual measurement fragments in EPL, rather than having to listen for and dissect entire measurements. For detailed information, see [Measurement fragments](/apama/advanced/#measurement-fragments).
