### Migration notes

When Cumulocity IoT is upgraded to 10.6.0, you must also upgrade the Apama-ctrl microservice from earlier versions to 10.6.0. This is mandatory due to a change in the communication protocol between Cumulocity IoT and Apama. Earlier versions of the Apama-ctrl microservice will not function correctly if running in Cumulocity IoT 10.6.0.

### Improvements in Apama EPL Apps

It is now possible to listen for individual measurement fragments in EPL, rather than having to listen for and dissect entire measurements. For detailed information, see [Measurement fragments](/apama/advanced/#measurement-fragments).
