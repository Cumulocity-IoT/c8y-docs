### Migration notes

When Cumulocity IoT is upgraded to 10.6.0, you must also upgrade the  Apama-ctrl microservice from 10.5.7 to 10.6.0. This is mandatory due to a change in the communication protocol between Cumulocity IoT and Apama.  The Apama-ctrl microservice for 10.5.7 will not function correctly if it is running in Cumulocity IoT 10.6.0.
