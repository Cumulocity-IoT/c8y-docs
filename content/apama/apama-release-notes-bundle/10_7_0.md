### Apama correlator version

This release of Cumulocity IoT Streaming Analytics includes the Apama version 10.7.0 correlator.

### Improvements in Apama EPL Apps

Both `Measurement` and `MeasurementFragment` events are now always available when activating an EPL app. It is no longer required to change a tenant option for this. So your apps can choose to listen for either of these, based on your requirements. The `apama.measurementFormat` tenant option from previous versions is no longer supported.
