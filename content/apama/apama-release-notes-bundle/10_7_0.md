### Apama correlator version

This release of Cumulocity IoT Streaming Analytics includes the Apama version 10.7.0 correlator.

### Improvements in alarms generated by the Apama-ctrl microservice

The following improvements are available in this release:

* `smartrule_restore_failed`<br>
  This is a new alarm type which is raised if a corrupt smart rule is present in the inventory and the correlator therefore fails to recover it correctly during startup. See [Smart rule restore failed](/apama/troubleshooting/#smartrule_restore_failed) for more information.
* `apama_safe_mode`<br>
  Safe mode is now enabled when the microservice has been restarted more that 2 times in the last 20 minutes. See [Safe mode on startup](/apama/troubleshooting/#apama_safe_mode) for more information.

### Improvements in Apama EPL Apps

Both `Measurement` and `MeasurementFragment` events are now always available when activating an EPL app. It is no longer required to change a tenant option for this. So your apps can choose to listen for either of these, based on your requirements. The `apama.measurementFormat` tenant option from previous versions is no longer supported.

The previously undocumented `payload.attrs` entry in `params` of  the EPL objects for managed objects, events, alarms and operations has  been replaced with an entry named by the `PARAM_NOTIFICATION` constant. The value is the value of the `NOTIFICATION_CREATED` and `NOTIFICATION_UPDATED` constant  values. It is recommended that EPL uses the new constant values. See also [Distinguishing between update and create notifications](/apama/analytics-introduction/#notifications).
