### Apama correlator version

This release of Cumulocity IoT Streaming Analytics includes the Apama version 10.7.0 correlator.

### Improvements in Apama EPL Apps

Both `Measurement` and `MeasurementFragment` events are now always available when activating an EPL app. It is no longer required to change a tenant option for this. So your apps can choose to listen for either of these, based on your requirements. The `apama.measurementFormat` tenant option from previous versions is no longer supported.

The previously undocumented `payload.attrs` entry in `params` of  the EPL objects for managed objects, events, alarms and operations has  been replaced with an entry named by the `PARAM_NOTIFICATION` constant. The value is the value of the `NOTIFICATION_CREATED` and `NOTIFICATION_UPDATED` constant  values. It is recommended that EPL uses the new constant values.
