### Apama correlator version

This release of Cumulocity IoT Streaming Analytics includes the Apama version 10.5.3 correlator.

### Improvements in alarms generated by the Apama-ctrl microservice

The following improvements are available in this release:

- `application_queue_full`<br>
  This is a new alarm type which is raised whenever the correlator queue is full, including both input queue and output queue. See [The correlator queue is full](/apama/troubleshooting/#application_queue_full) for more information.
  
- `APAMA_CTRL_WARN_<HASHCODE>`<br>
  This is an enhancement to the existing alarm type. An alarm is now raised when the correlator context is blocked for too long, not letting any other applications run in the same context or, even worse, cause excessive memory pressure (as the correlator is unable to perform any garbage collection cycles) leading to the application running out of memory. See [An EPL file blocks the correlator context for too long](/apama/troubleshooting/#apama_ctrl_warn) for more information.
