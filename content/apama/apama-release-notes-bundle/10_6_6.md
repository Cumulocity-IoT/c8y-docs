### Apama correlator version

This release of Cumulocity IoT Streaming Analytics includes the Apama version 10.5.3 correlator.

### Improvements in alarms generated by the Apama-ctrl microservice

The following new alarm types are now available:

- `application_queue_full`<br>
  This alarm is raised whenever the correlator queue is full, including both input queue and output queue. See [The correlator queue is full](/apama/troubleshooting/#application_queue_full) for more information.
  
- `APAMA_CTRL_WARN_<HASHCODE>`<br>
  This alarm is raised when an EPL file blocks the correlator context for too long, not letting any other applications run in the same context or, even worse, cause excessive memory pressure (as the correlator is unable to perform any garbage collection cycles) leading to the application running out of memory. See [An EPL file blocks the correlator context for too long](/apama/troubleshooting/#apama_ctrl_warn) for more information.
