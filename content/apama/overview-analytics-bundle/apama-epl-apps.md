Apama EPL Apps is a web application which is available from the application switcher. It allows you to develop EPL apps (that is, single \*.mon files) directly within Cumulocity IoT, written in Apama EPL. You can also use it to import existing \*.mon files as EPL apps into Cumulocity IoT. When you activate an EPL app via the Apama EPL Apps web application, you deploy it to Cumulocity IoT.

A quick way to get started is to explore the code of the EPL samples that can be accessed from the EPL editor in the Apama EPL Apps web application. See [Developing apps with Apama EPL Apps](/apama/analytics-introduction//#apama-epl-apps) for information on how to create an EPL app and access the samples. For a start, use one of the simpler samples with temperature measurements, such as "Raise Alarm if Measurement exceeds a threshold value". You can immediately see results using this sample. Add your own EPL code to the sample and try out your changes. 

You use the Apama API for interacting with Cumulocity IoT. For detailed information, see the `com.apama.cumulocity` package in the  [API Reference for EPL (ApamaDoc)](https://documentation.softwareag.com/onlinehelp/Rohan/Apama/v10-5/apama10-5/ApamaDoc/index.html?com/apama/cumulocity/package-summary.html), which is part of the Apama documentation.
