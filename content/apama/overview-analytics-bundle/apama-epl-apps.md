Apama EPL Apps is a web application which is available from the application switcher. It allows you to develop Apama apps (*.mon files) directly within Cumulocity IoT, written in Apama EPL. You can also use it to import existing Apama monitor (\*.mon) files as apps into Cumulocity IoT. When you then activate an Apama app, you deploy it to Cumulocity IoT.

> **Info:** EPL apps and EPL applications are not the same. EPL apps are single *.mon files that are destined to be deployed via the Apama EPL Apps web application. They are thus smaller, slightly more restricted subsets of Apama EPL applications, which can be developed with the full Apama (PAM) product. 

See [Basic functionality](/apama/analytics-introduction/) for further information.
