Apama EPL Apps is a web application which is available from the application switcher. It allows you to develop Apama applications directly within Cumulocity IoT, written in Apama EPL. You can also use it to import existing Apama applications (\*.mon files) into Cumulocity IoT. When you then activate an Apama application, you deploy it to Cumulocity IoT.

See [Basic functionality](/guides/apama/analytics-introduction/) for further information.
