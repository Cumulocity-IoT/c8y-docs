Edge is delivered as a software appliance designed to run on industrial PC's or local servers.

In contrast to {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform, which is available in the cloud (for example, using AWS, Azure or other data centers), Edge is installed in factories, that is, in the same site ("onsite") in which the IoT assets are located.    

Reasons for using an onsite installation of Edge include:

* **Autonomy**: Even if there is no cloud connection, tasks like data collection and data analysis can still be performed.
* **Data reduction**: Data is analyzed and aggregated close to assets, and thus less data needs to be sent to the cloud.
* **Reactivity**: Both Edge and {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform include real-time streaming analytics engines. However, placing the rule execution in Edge reduces latency, because the round-trip to cloud is omitted.

Features of Edge include:

* Edge Agent, which enables remote monitoring and management of an Edge instance from the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant.
* Data Broker to send IoT data to the cloud and receive operations from the cloud, with web-based UI to filter data.
* Streaming Analytics engine for real-time local data analysis including the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Analytics Builder.
* Ready-to-use Cockpit and Device Management applications.
* Native protocol support for MQTT and REST.
* Edge database for operational data storage.
* [OPC UA](/protocol-integration/opcua/) with web-based UI for efficient and secure connection management, seamless integration and interoperability in industrial automation systems.
* Easy installation, upgrades and backup/restore.
* Microservice hosting, which allows to run server-side applications which may be used to extend the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform with customer-specific functionality (optional component).
* [DataHub Edge](/datahub/running-datahub-on-the-edge/) for historical data storage and analytics (optional component).
