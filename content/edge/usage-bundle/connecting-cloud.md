Cumulocity IoT Edge provides the option to upload Edge data to a Cumulocity Cloud account selectively (note that you first need to create a Cloud account).

You can share the following data:

* devices (and more generically, managed objects)
* events
* alarms
* measurements
* operations

Navigate to **Data connectors** if you would like to send data to the Cloud account. 

Navigate to **Data subscriptions** in your cloud account to receive the data from Edge.

In the same way, you can push operations from a Cumulocity Cloud account to Cumulocity IoT Edge devices.
 
For details on sending and receiving data in Cumulocity refer to Enterprise Edition > [Using the Data Broker](/guides/users-guide/enterprise-edition#data-broker) in the User guide.
