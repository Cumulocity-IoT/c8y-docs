Cumulocity IoT Edge provides the option to upload Edge data to a Cumulocity Cloud account selectively (note that you first need to create a Cloud account).

You can share the following data:

* devices (and more generically, managed objects)
* events
* alarms
* measurements

>**Important**: Data Broker in Cumulocity IoT Edge does not support synchronization of the Operations.

Navigate to **Data connectors** if you would like to send data to the Cloud account. 

Navigate to **Data subscriptions** in your cloud account to receive the data from Edge.
