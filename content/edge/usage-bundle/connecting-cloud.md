Cumulocity IoT Edge provides the option to upload Edge data to a Cumulocity Cloud account selectively. Note that you must first create a cloud account. To configure the cloud account in your Edge device, see [Configure Edge Agent](/guides/edge/installation/#option-7-configure-edge-agent).

You can share the following data:

* devices (and more generically, managed objects)
* events
* alarms
* measurements
* operations

Go to **Data connectors** if you would like to send data to the cloud account. 

Go to **Data subscriptions** in your cloud account to receive the data from Edge.

In the same way, you can push operations from a Cumulocity cloud account to Cumulocity IoT Edge devices.
 
For details about sending and receiving data in Cumulocity, see [Enterprise Tenant > Using the Data Broker](/guides/users-guide/enterprise-edition#data-broker).
