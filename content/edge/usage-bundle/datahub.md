The Cumulocity IoT Edge platform allows you to manage and monitor a variety of devices. The data emitted by these devices is stored in Cumulocity's Operational Store, with older data potentially being removed (based on data retention settings). In order to run an ad-hoc query against recent device data, Cumulocity offers a [REST API](/guides/reference/rest-implementation/). For more information about operating DataHub, see [Running DataHub on the Edge](/guides/datahub/running-datahub-on-the-edge/).
