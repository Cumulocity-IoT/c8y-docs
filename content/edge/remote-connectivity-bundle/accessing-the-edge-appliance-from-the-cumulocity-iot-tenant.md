Starting with {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge Release 10.15, the support for the Telnet protocol has been removed, as Telnet is considered to be an insecure protocol lacking built-in security measures. For accessing the Edge appliance remotely from the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant, {{< company-sag >}} recommends you to use the SSH protocol instead.
