>**Info**: Backup of opcua-agent-server data

If you use opcua-agent-server and you are upgrading from Edge 10.4 April 2019 or below version to the latest version, you must execute the below mentioned commands in your EDGE VM. This has to be done before following any of the steps described below.<br>Additionally, please request the Cumulocity support for root user credentials if you donâ€™t have it.

```shell
mkdir -p /usr/edge/properties/opcua/db
cp -a /etc/opcua/db/. /usr/edge/properties/opcua/db/
```


Follow the steps below to upgrade the system. 

1. Power off the VM. To do so, access the VM and run the following command in the terminal:<br>
```shell
sudo shutdown
```

2. Navigate to the VM directory. For VirtualBox it is *[USER-DIRECTORY]\VirtualBox VMs*. Move the entire VM folder (e.g. EDGE-server) to a safe location.
