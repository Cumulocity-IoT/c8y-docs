In case of any issues, we recommend you to follow these steps:

* Perform a health check, see the [Health check](/edge/diagnostics-and-support/#health-check) section.
* Monitor the system processes, see the [Monitoring](/edge/diagnostics-and-support/#monitoring) section.
* Check the log files, see the [Log files](/edge/diagnostics-and-support/#logs-files) section.

These steps help you analyze the issue and provide a fix. If you still need to contact {{< company-sag >}} support, include the output of the diagnostics dump. For more information about using the diagnostics, see [Diagnostics](#diagnostics).
