Cumulocity IoT Edge Release 10.5, November 2019, includes the following improvements and fixes:

### Improvements

* **Post installation** - A new parameter is added in the *config.dat* file.<br>If you are running the post-installation script using the *config.dat* file, there is a new  parameter required in that file called `cloud.url`. If you do not want to specify a cloud URL, use an empty string as the value. This is relevant for customers who are performing automated runs of the post-installation by specifying an existing file.

* **Custom rules** - After upgrading to Edge version 10.5, you must upload the custom rules from an older installation again. The custom rules from an older installation are not migrated automatically during the upgrade process.

#### Apama

* Cumulocity IoT Edge Release 10.5 includes Apama 10.5.0.
* If you are upgrading to Cumulocity IoT Edge version 10.5 from any previous version, note that you must redeploy all of your EPL files. See [Apama streaming analytics - New code editor and manager](/guides/release-notes/10-4-6/#apama-streaming-analytics-new-code-editor-and-manager).
