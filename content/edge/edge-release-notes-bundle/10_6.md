Cumulocity IoT Edge Release 10.6, April 2020, includes the following improvements, fixes and known issues:

### Hosting microservices

You can now develop and deploy microservices in Cumulocity IoT Edge. For more information, see [Microservices SDK](/guides/microservice-sdk/introduction/).

This enhancement includes some changes to the monitoring and diagnostic utilities:

* Diagnostic utility changes:
	* The health of the Kubernetes platform components and the hosted microservices have been added to the list of health endpoints monitored by diagnostic monitor.
	* Diagnostic data collector collects the logs of the Kubernetes platform components as well as the logs of the hosted microservices. For more information, see [Microservices log file locations](/guides/edge/operation/#microservices-log-file-locations).

### Support for remote access protocols

Cumulocity IoT Edge now supports the VNC and Telnet protocols to remotely access the Edge VM. See [Connecting to the cloud](/guides/edge/usage/#connecting-cloud).

### Support for OPC UA 2.0

OPC UA 2.0 is now available. For more information, see [OPC UA](/guides/users-guide/optional-services/#opc-ua) section in the User guide.

### Cumulocity IoT DataHub

Cumulocity IoT DataHub is now available in the Cumulocity IoT Edge platform as an integrated application, available from the application switcher. For more information, see [Cumulocity IoT DataHub](/guides/datahub/running-datahub-on-the-edge/).

|:---|:---|:---
|CIE-343|Apama Analytics Builder|**Issue:** After upgrading the Edge VM, you cannot use Analytics Builder.<br>**Workaround:**<br>1.	Get the application ID for the Apama Analytics Builder application by running the following command:<br>**Important:** You should use the password of the **sysadmin** user. See [Changing the sysadmin password](/guides/edge/installation/#changing-the-sysadmin-password).<br><br> ```curl -u 'management/sysadmin:<sysadmin password>' -v -X GET http://<Edge_VM_URL>/application/applicationsByName/Apama%20Analytics%20Builder```<br><br>To find the application ID in the JSON output, look for the lines:<br>`"id": "12"`<br>`"key": "apamaanalyticsbuilder"`<br><br>2. Update the key of the application by replacing `"key": "apamaanalyticsbuilder"` with `"key": "apamaanalyticsbuilder-key"`:<br><br>`curl -u 'management/sysadmin:sysadmin-pass' -v -X PUT -H “Content-Type: application/json” -d ‘{“key”: “apamaanalyticsbuilder-key” }’ http://<Edge_VM_URL>/application/applications/12` <br> A response 200 is expected and you should be able to use Apama Analytics Builder after upgrading the Edge VM.
|CIE-852|VMware Workstation|**Issue:** On VMware Workstation, you should use UTC on your host machine. If you choose not to use UTC, you may have time sync issues.<br>**Workaround:** Set `rtc.diffFromUTC=0` in the .vmx file.|
|CIE-892|Virtual Box|**Issue:** On Virtual Box, you should use UTC on your host machine. If you choose not to use UTC, you may have time sync issues.<br>**Workaround:** Set the `VBoxInternal/Devices/mc146818/0/Config/UseUTC` key value to 1.|
