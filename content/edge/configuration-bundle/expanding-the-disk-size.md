You can expand the disk size using the REST APIs. Before expanding the disk size, you must set or edit the disk size in the hypervisor. See the hypervisor specific documentation for editing the disk size.

To expand the disk size of the installation disk and the data disk, use the following endpoint:

- [POST /edge/expand-disk](/edge/rest-api/#post-edgeexpand-disk)
