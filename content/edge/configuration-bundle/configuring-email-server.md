Configuring an email server enables you to receive email notifications about events, alarms, and also to reset your password. In case you forget the password, the Edge appliance mails you the password reset link to reset your password.

To configure the "reset password" template and email server settings, perform the following steps:

1. Log into the {{< management-tenant >}} using *https://&#60;tenant-domain>/apps/administration/index.html#/configuration*.

	- Username: management/<*Edge admin username*>
	- Password: password provided during the installation

2. Update the email server details and templates as mentioned in [Configuring password reset](/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/#password-reset) and [Configuring email server](/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/#email-server) in the *User guide*.
