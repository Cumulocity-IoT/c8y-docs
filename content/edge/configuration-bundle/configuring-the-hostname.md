The default hostname of the Edge appliance is **iot-edge-server**. You can define a unique hostname for your Edge appliance as per your requirements. A unique hostname ensures seamless communication within the network, avoids any hostname conflicts with other network devices and improves the security of your Edge device.

### Configuring the hostname using the UI

1. Log in to the {{< management-tenant >}} using the Edge administrator credentials created during the installation.

   - Username: management/<*Edge admin username*>
   - Password: password provided during the installation
2. Switch to the Administration application using the application switcher at the right of the top bar **<img class="Default" src="/images/icons/switcher-icon.png" alt="icon" style="display: inline; float: none">**.
3. Click **Edge** > **Hostname** in the navigator.
4. Click **Edit** to change the hostname.
5. Provide the new hostname and click **Save**.
