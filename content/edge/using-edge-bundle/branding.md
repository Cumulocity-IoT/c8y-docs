With the Branding feature, you can fully customize the look of your tenant to your own preferences.

In the **Branding** tab, you can configure various parameters like logos, colors  and font types used throughout the platform.

The [parameters](#configuration-parameters) are configured at the left side of the tab while at the right you can immediately see your selections applied to a preview extract.
