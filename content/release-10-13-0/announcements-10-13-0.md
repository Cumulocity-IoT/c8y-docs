##### opcua-device-gateway downgrades from 10.13.0

For security reasons, opcua-device-gateway downgrades from 10.13.0 to previous versions will not be directly supported. Downgrading to a previous version is still possible though by following the downgrade instructions as described in the OPC UA protocol integration documentation for release 10.13.0.
