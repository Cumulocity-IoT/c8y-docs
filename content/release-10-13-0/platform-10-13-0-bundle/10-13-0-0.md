<tr>
<td>
Administration </td>
<td> In the <b>Own Applications</b> detail view the read-only fields are now properly disabled so that it is clear that they cannot be edited. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td> In the SMS provider configuration certain tenant options can be inherited from the microservice owner tenant. Previously, this could not be determined from the UI. Now an additional hint (inherited from &#60;tenantID&#62;) will be displayed to denote that. </td>
<td>
MTM-38050</td>

<tr>
<td>
Billing</td>
<td> Two additional fields have been introduced to the device statistics:
<br>- deviceType - value of the <code>type</code> field from the corresponding device
<br>- deviceParents - list of unique identifiers of parents for the corresponding device </td>

<tr>
<td>
Core platform </td>
<td> Created a scheduled task which is executed once a week, that will update the alarm count for each existing managed object. The fragment <code>c8y_ActiveAlarmsStatus</code> will be updated. This fragment stores map: alarm severity -> count. The fix solves inconsistencies with the count, and the state of the database, and it is by default executed every Sunday at 11:10 PM, which can be configured by an operations team.  </td>
<td>
MTM-39515</td>

<tr>
<td>
Inventory roles </td>
<td> The performance of inventory roles has been improved. GET requests for alarms, events, and measurements work much faster now for users with inventory-role access when querying with the parameter "source", but without the parameters "withSourceDevices" or "withSourceAssets". This feature must be enabled on platform level or on tenant level via tenant-option. The tenant option has 2 possible values: LEGACY / OPTIMIZED, where LEGACY currently is the global default. The option looks like the following in the REST API:
<br> <code>{ "category": "configuration", "key": "acl.algorithm-version", "value": "OPTIMIZED"} </code> </td>
<td>

<tr>
<td>
Microservice</td>
<td> The "cep" microservice has been removed from the list of default microservices for new installations.</td>
<td>
MTM-39794</td>

<tr>
<td>
Microservice </td>
<td> As a microservice provider you can define higher values than 256 MB memory and 250Mi CPU as resources request in the microservice manifest. </td>
<td>
MTM-40361</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td> The REST API has been updated to provide the ability to query alarms and events by filtering using <code>lastUpdatedFrom=&lt;iso-date-time&gt;</code> and <code>lastUpdatedTo=&lt;iso-date-time&gt;</code> parameters. </td>
<td>
MTM-41364</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td> The legacy Dozer library has been removed from Cumulocity IoT core and CEP Esper, improving security by removing redundant code. </td>
<td>
MTM-38301</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Messaging Service</td>
<td> It is now possible to configure a HTTP/HTTPS proxy for the data broker agent microservice, in the usual manner for microservices. See <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/microservice-sdk/concept/#proxy-variables" class="no-ajaxy">General aspects > Microservice manifest</a> in the <i>Microservice SDK guide</i>. </td>

REST API</td>
<td> When green password is enforced and the minimal strong password length (<code>system.password.green.min-length</code> property) is higher than the device password length (<code>device-user.password.length</code> property), the system will use the green.min-length value, i.e. generate a longer password.
