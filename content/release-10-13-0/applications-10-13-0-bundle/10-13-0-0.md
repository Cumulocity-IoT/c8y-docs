Web SDK</td>
<td > A slider component <code>RangeComponent</code> has been added to the Web SDK. The new component allows developers to show range sliders with a Cumulocity IoT layout. Documentation is available under <a href="http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/ngx-components/modules/FormsModule.html" class="no-ajaxy">http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/ngx-components/modules/FormsModule.html</a>. The usage example is available in the tutorial application.</td>

Web SDK</td>
<td> The WebSDK now supports, and uses by default, the new Ivy rendering engine from Angular. You can opt-in Ivy on existing applications by:
<br> - Setting "enableIvy" to true in your <i>tsconfig.json</i>.
<br> - Adding the Angular Compatibility Compiler (ngcc) to your scripts in <i>package.json</i>: "postinstall": "ngcc" </td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> The child devices grid has been improved to work like the sub-assets grid. It is now possible to filter devices, and pagination has been added. The auto-refresh via real-time notifications for the child devices page has been removed as it wouldn't scale well when filters are applied. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> The documentation for the <code>c8y-data-grid</code> component has been improved and usage examples have been added to the tutorial application. </td>

<td> Developers using the Web SDK now have the possibility to create named dashboards (dashboards stored with a given name in the database) with a context (device or group). </td>

<td> Cumulocity IoT Web SDK has been upgraded to Angular 12. </td>

<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> The AngularJS implementation of the Cumulocity IoT dashboards has been removed. The following modules from the @c8y/ng1-modules package are affected:
<br>- modules/dashboardUI
<br>- modules/dashboard2
<br>- modules/cockpit-reports </td>
<td>
MTM-40537</td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> The AngularJS module <code>c8y.deviceBulkControl</code> is no longer used in standard applications and has been removed. To take advantage of standard UI components for bulk operations you should use the components and services of the <code>@c8y/ngx-components/operations</code> library.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Cockpit</td>
<td> In the Cockpit and Device Management application, <b>Load more</b> in the navigator menu is now disabled, while the assets load request is in progress, after clicking the button. Previously it was possible to click the <b>Load more</b> button multiple times before the browser had a response, and that resulted in getting duplicated groups in the list.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> For easier navigation on mobile devices, you must now use two fingers to zoom in and out on the "Maps" widget. Placing one finger on the map allows you to scroll instead. To achieve this, it was necessary to update the "leaflet" library to the latest version. If you have implemented your own custom map on top of our Web SDK, please check that your implementation still works properly.</td>
