Release 10.13.0 includes the following new features or major feature enhancements.

### New Ecocsystem menu

The previous **Applications** page in the Administration application has been restructured to provide a clearer organization and navigation. A new **Ecosystem** menu entry is available now, grouped into **Applications** and **Microservices**. The **Applications** page shows an **All applications** tab listing the web and external applications, and a **Feature** tab, listing the applications of the type "feature". The **Microservices** page list all applications of the type "microservice". The separation between subscribed and own applications is now reflected by labels in the application lists (subscribed or custom).
