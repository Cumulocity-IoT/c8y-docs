This section describes how to develop and deploy microservices on top of Cumulocity using the Microservice SDK for Java. It also contains a [Hello world tutorial](#java-microservice) that you may follow to get the basics of developing microservices using Java. After you have successfully deployed your first microservice to Cumulocity, you may also continue with the section [Developing microservices](#developing-microservice) to learn more about other features and capabilities of the SDK.

> **Info**: You can develop microservices for Cumulocity with any IDE and build tool that you prefer, but this section focuses on Maven and some troubleshooting for Eclipse.

These are some useful references to get started with the basic technologies underlying the SDK:

- The client libraries use the Cumulocity REST interfaces as underlying communication protocol as described in the section [Using the REST interface](/microservice-sdk/rest).
- All examples are open source and can be reviewed at the [Cumulocity microservices examples](https://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-examples/src/develop/microservices/) repository.

> **Important:** You need to have at least version 7 of the [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) installed in your development environment as older versions of the JRE and JDK are not updated with the latest security patches and are not recommended for use in production.
