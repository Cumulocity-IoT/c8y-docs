Microservices need to understand certain details about the specific Cumulocity cluster they run in. For example, a microservice needs to know the endpoint address of the Cumulocity REST APIs. This information is provided by environment variables and they are injected by Cumulocity when the container is started.

Refer to [Microservice runtime](/guides/reference/microservice-runtime) in the Reference guide for a list of provided environment variables.
