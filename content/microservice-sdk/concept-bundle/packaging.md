To deploy a microservice, it needs to be packaged as docker image. It requires a docker image.tar and cumulocity.json files packed into a zip file. For your convenience, Cumulocity provides a script. 

Refer to [Microservice package reference](/guides/reference/microservice-package) in the Reference guide in order to prepare and deploy the microservice package.
