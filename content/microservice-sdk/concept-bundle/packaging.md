A microservice has to be packed as a Docker image in order to be deployed.
It requires a Docker _image.tar_ and _cumulocity.json_ files packed into a zip file. For your convenience, Cumulocity provides a script to ease packaging, deployment and subscription. Refer to [Microservice package and deploy](/guides/reference/microservice-package) in the Reference guide to download the script and learn how to employ it.
