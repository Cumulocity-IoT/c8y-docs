If scaling is enabled, the microservice will be horizontally auto-scaled in case of high CPU usage. Auto scaling monitors the microservices to make sure that they are operating at the desired performance levels, so it will automatically scale up your cluster as soon as you need it and scale it back down when you donâ€™t.

The scale option is set using the [Microservice manifest](#manifest).
