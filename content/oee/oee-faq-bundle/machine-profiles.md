### What are the effects of a name change of a profile?

The corresponding profile can still be found by using the profile-ID, which does not change. The name of the c8y_child_device does not change either.

### How do I assig an external profile to an entity (site, area, line)

![External program](/images/oee/faq/faq-external-program.png)

1. Go to the "Admin" section
2. Go to the "Organization" subsection
3. Search for the profile in the list "Unassigned entities"
4. Add the profile to the entity by clicking on the button "Assign", see left.
