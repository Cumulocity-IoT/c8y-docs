After creating and activating a profile, it might take some time to see the first OEE calcuation results. For each interval the values for availability, quality and performance need to be calculated before an OEE value is calculated. Availability, performance, and quality are calculated when the interval has finished. This is determined through the reception of data relevant for the calculation with a timestamp after the end of the interval. Only after these calculations the interval can be closed and the final OEE result can displayed.
