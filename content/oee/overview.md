Welcome to the Cumulocity IoT OEE application.

**OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)** is a framework for measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of production processes, by breaking them down into the three components availability, performance, and quality. OEE helps you identify and measure problems, and provides a standard method of benchmarking progress.

The Cumulocity IoT OEE application provides a flexible and convenient way to use OEE in the IIoT context - providing a platform to create a semantic for machine and operating data, and the capability to connect different systems and services.
