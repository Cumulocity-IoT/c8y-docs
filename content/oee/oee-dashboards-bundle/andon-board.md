The **Andon Board** displays and constantly updates the values OEE, Availability, Performance and Quality for each entity in the **Machine Park Overview**.

<span style="color:red">TODO: Every 10 minutes still? Or is it influenced by machines and their intervals? checkme. </span>
The update interval of the values in the **Andon Board** for sites, areas and lines is set to 10 minutes.

For machines, the update interval is the default value set in the machine's profile, but can be adjusted by clicking **Interval** at the top right. It is also possible to select individual shifts as the interval. The last update time is given at the top of the page above the OEE values. If the machine is not currently part of a productive shift, this will be indicated here also.
