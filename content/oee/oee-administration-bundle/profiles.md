### Profile settings page

The Admin User has access to the *Profile settings* in the Admin View. He can create profiles of lines and machines here by either clicking on the '*Create new machine profile*' or the '*Create new line profile*' Button.

After a new profile is created it will be displayed in the overview of this page where you can edit, delete or change the status of the existing profiles:

* *Green Play Icon:* Machine Profile is currently in use
* *Grey Play Icon:* Machine Profile is not currently in use
* *Orange Circle Icon:* Machine Profile is not completed

The process of creating a new machine profile will be explained in the following.
