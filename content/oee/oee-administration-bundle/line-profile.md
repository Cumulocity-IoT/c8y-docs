The following section walks you through the steps required to create a new line profile.

### Step 1 - Create a new site

Since lines are attached to a site or an area, you first need to have such an entity available.

Switch to the [Organization](/oee/oee-administration/#organization) page under **Administration** and create a new site as described in [Organization > To create a new entity](/oee/oee-administration/#create-entity).

You can skip this step if you have already a site or area available to which you want to attach the new line profile.

### Step 2 - Create a new line

Next, create a new line in a similar way, this time selecting "Line" as entity type.

### Step 3 - Attach the line to a site

1. Click the **Add** button on the site to which you want to attach a line (entity).
2. Select your desired line and click **Add**.

The line will be added to the site in the **Organization structure** and get represented in the [**Machine Park Overview**](/oee/dashboards/#machine-park).

### Step 4 Add machines to the line

1. Click the **Add** button at the right of the line.
2. Select the machines you want to assign to the line and click **Add**.


### Step 5 - Create a line profile

Create a new line profile in the **Profile** Page under **Administration**, as described in [**Line profiles**](/oee/administration/#line-profile).


### Step 6 - Activate the line profile

To complete the creation of a new line profile you have to activate it in the **Organization** page under **Administration**. The grey button indicates, that the profile is inactive and by clicking on it the profile will get activated, see picture.

**Info:** Make sure that all machine profiles of the line are activated.

### Calculation example of a line profile

#### Initial situation

In a production line there are two machine tools and one measuring machine in a row. The workpiece first passes through machine tool 1, then machine tool 2 and finally the measuring machine.

The quality of the workpiece is measured at the measuring machine and not derived from the process parameters of the machine tools.

#### Mapping + calculation logic (streaming analytics)

##### Calculation of the availability

To calculate the availability of the entire line, all three machines are considered. For each machine a machine profile is created which determines the production time based on the measured value "ActCycle", see the image below.

To calculate the availability of the line, all three values (Actual Production Time) of the machine profiles are combined and divided by the number of machines. The aim here is a static consideration of availability and no availability is calculated in relation to a single workpiece. In this respect, this logic is also applicable to discrete as well as process manufacturing.

##### Calculation of the performance

The run rate is determined at the bottleneck machine, for example at the output rate of the last machine, here the measuring machine. Thus, the total run time of the workpiece is not considered.

##### Calculation of the quality

The quality quantity is derived directly from the quality events. This event is generated by the measuring machine.
