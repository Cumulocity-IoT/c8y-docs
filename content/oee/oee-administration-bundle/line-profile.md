### Create a new site

Start by creating a new Site (entity) in the [Organization](/oee/oee-administration/#organization) Tab of the Admin View.

1. Click '*Create a new entity*' button
2. Give the new entity a name (mandatory)
3. Add a description (optional)
4. Define OEE Target value (mandatory)
5. Select '*Site*' as entity type


Lines have to be attached to a *Site* or an *Area* and therefore we start by creating one of these entities.

### Create a new Line

Now create a new line profile:

1. Click '*Create a new entity'* button
2. Give the new entity a name (mandatory)
3. Add a description (optional)
4. Define OEE Target value (mandatory)
5. Select '*Line*' as entity type


After finishing the configuration the Line (entity) will be displayed in the *Organization-Structure*.

### Attach Line to the Site

1. Click the add (+) button on the Site (entity) to which you want to attach the Line (entity)
2. Select your desired line and click confirm by clicking add


The line will be added to the Site in the Organization Structure and they are represented in the [Machine Park](/oee/dashboards/#machine-park)

### Add Machines to the Line

Add the desired machines to the line.

### Create a new line profile

Create a new line profile in the profile tab of the admin page.

1. Give the profile a name
2. Save and continue
3. Select the desired line as shown in the picture to the left</p>

It is also possible to create a new line profile on the basis of an already existing profile just like it is possible with machine profiles.

Continue with the line mapping >; You are now able to use the data of the machines you have previously assigned to the line.

### Delete Line (entity) in the Organization Tab

Go back to the *Organization* Tab of the Admin view and unassign the previously attached line entity from the created site by clicking on the red delete button.

*Note:*

In case you chose to completely delete the line entity, the created profile will be treated as an external profile. Make sure to unassign but not to delete the entity.

### Attach the Line Profile to the Site

Attach the created line profile to the previously created entity (Site, Area, ...) by clicking the add button (+) in the Organizations Tab.

### Activate Line Profile

To finalize the creation of a new line profile you have to activate it in the *Organization* tab of the admin view. The grey button indicates, that the profile is inactive and by clicking on it the profile will get activated, see picture.

*Note:*

Please ensure, that all machine profiles of the line are activated.

### Calculation example of a line profile

#### Initial Situation

In a production line there are 2 machine-tools and a measuring machine in a row and the workpiece first passes through machine-tool 1, then machine-tool 2 and finally the measuring machine.

The quality of the workpiece is measured at the measuring machine and not derived from the process parameters of the machine tools.

#### Mapping + calculation logic (Streaming Analytics)

**Calculation of the Avaiability:**<br>
To calculate the availability of the entire line, all three machines are considered. For each machine a machine profile is created which determines the production time based on the measured value "ActCycle", see figure on the left.

To calculate the availability of the line, all three values (Actual Production Time) of the machine profiles are combined and divided by the number of machines. The aim here is a static consideration of availability and no availability is calculated in relation to a single workpiece. In this respect, this logic is also applicable to discrete as well as process manufacturing.

**Calculation of the Performance:**<br>
The run rate is determined at the bottleneck machine, for example at the output rate of the last machine, here the measuring machine. Thus, the total run time of the workpiece is not considered.

**Calculation of the Quality:**<br>
The quality quantity is derived directly from the quality events. This event is generated by the measuring machine.
