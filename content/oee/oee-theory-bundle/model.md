The capturability of values is indicated by the adjectives used in terminology such as 'ideal', 'potential' and 'actual'. The identification of captureable values is given by the adjectives used in terminology such as "potential", "actual" and "ideal". Since the actual quantities are real quantities, they can be measured. Potential key figures cannot be measured at the machine, but can be derived from planning values of the organization. Ideal values, on the other hand, must be calculated and cannot be recorded directly.

This model represents the view on the quantity, as well as on the time, in one diagram. To make this clear to the observer, the terms end with 'amount', '-amount', 'time' or '-time'. If terms do not have these endings or if there is a special case, as with the ideal cyles, round brackets indicate whether the term refers to the quantity, time, quantity & time or a ratio, indicated in quantity per time, time per quantity, or percentage. The exact specification of units for quantity and time was deliberately dispensed in order to further underline the generic applicability. To show that the relationship to quantity or time is ultimately irrelevant, corresponding terms are linked with the following symbol:

This allows a generic application at many different companies, because different machine measurement data can be used. The conversion takes place with the help of the '<em>ideal cycle amount</em> or <em>time</em>', which is explained below. All quantities described as not ideal thus refer to the real machine and can therefore also be measured directly or indirectly.
