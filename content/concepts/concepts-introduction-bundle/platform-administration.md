{{< product-c8y-iot >}} provides a dedicated application for the [platform administration](/standard-tenant/standard-tenant-introduction/) that allows administrators to manage key areas such as tenant and application management, security and user management as well as data sharing.

With [Enterprise Tenants](/enterprise-tenant/enterprise-tenant-introduction/), {{< product-c8y-iot >}} supports full [multi-tenancy](/concepts/tenant-hierarchy/), allowing for a clear data separation as well as full customization including [white-labeling](/enterprise-tenant/customization/#branding) per tenant.

Custom [Web Applications](/standard-tenant/ecosystem/#managing-applications), [Extensions](/standard-tenant/ecosystem/#extensions) and [Microservices](/standard-tenant/ecosystem/#managing-microservices) can be deployed, [subscribed to tenants](/enterprise-tenant/managing-tenants/#subscribing-applications), managed and [monitored](/standard-tenant/ecosystem/#monitoring-microservices) by Administrators.

Fine-grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows defining precise device, user and service permissions. Customers bringing their own Identity and Access Management (IAM) System, can use [Single-Sign-On](/authentication/sso/) (SSO) for streamlined access. The platform also ensures device-level security through [certificate-based authentication](/device-integration/device-certificates/), safeguarding connections from unauthorized access.

Data sharing between tenants can be achieved through the [Data Broker](/data-broker/data-broker-application/), enabling efficient device data exchange while maintaining strict security controls.
