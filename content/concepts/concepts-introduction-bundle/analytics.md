{{< product-c8y-iot >}} offers powerful analytics capabilities that enable businesses to extract valuable insights from their data as well as to operationalise derived insights using real-time rules.Â 

For this, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} comes with [real-time data streaming and processing](/concepts/realtime/) capabilities, allowing businesses to process and take immediate action based on incoming data. Rules can be created within the [Streaming Analytics application](/streaming-analytics/introduction-analytics/#home) and the predefined [Smart Rules](/cockpit/smart-rules/) makes data analytics accessible also to non-technical users. Real-time rules do allow for both triggering external workflows (e.g. creation of a service ticket) as well as sending operations back to the equipment to e.g. optimize machine operations based on analytical insights.

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} also offers the optional [DataHub](/datahub/datahub-overview/) application that is geared towards data analysts and data scientists and allows for offloading of IoT data to a data lake storage as well as to perform complex SQL queries on the data to derive deeper insights.

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} integrates seamlessly with popular analytics tools and AI frameworks, allowing businesses to apply sophisticated algorithms to their IoT data. For more information on machine learning capabilities, refer to the [Machine Learning Introduction](/machine-learning/ml-introduction/) in the documentation.
