Effectively managing devices is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of deploying IoT solutions. Without proper device management in place, remote devices can quickly become unmanageable, leading to security risks, operational failures, and increased maintenance costs. This is especially true in the early stages of IoT projects, where considerations like secure onboarding and software/firmware updates are crucial for long-term success.

Connecting equipment to the internet requires secure and robust device management practices. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} greatly reduces the complexity and time required to manage a heterogeneous fleet of connected devices across its lifecycle through its comprehensive device management features:
