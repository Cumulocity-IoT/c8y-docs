With [{{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge](/edge/edge-introduction/), the full capabilities of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform can be deployed on a single industrial PC, providing flexibility for edge-based deployments. This deployment method allows businesses to run their IoT platform independently from the cloud, ensuring that critical operations continue seamlessly, even in environments with limited or no connectivity. The platform can be deployed in air-gapped networks, where it [supports strict security measures](/edge/edge-configuration/#configuring-security), including STIG compliance for enhanced cybersecurity. This makes it ideal for industries with stringent security requirements, such as defense or critical infrastructure.

The platform also integrates the [Data Broker](/data-broker/data-broker-application/) feature, enabling secure data sharing between edge deployments and cloud systems allowing for efficient data synchronization while maintaining strict control over what data is shared and how it is accessed, especially in isolated or highly secure networks.

With the same architecture as the cloud-based platform, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge enables seamless extension development in the cloud, which can later be deployed to any edge environment. This compatibility ensures that organizations can develop once and deploy across multiple environments, ensuring consistent functionality and simplifying the overall management of IoT solutions.
