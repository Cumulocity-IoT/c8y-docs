For some scenarios, it might be sufficient to manage separate users (like customers) within a single tenant. In this case, you manage the access rights for each user within the tenant by assigning roles, for example to specify which devices a user can see, and this way protect multiple users/customers from each other, see also [Security aspects > Access control](/concepts/security/#access-control). This approach is covered by the Standard Tenant. 

For other scenarios this approach might not be sufficient and it might be relevant to manage a portfolio of tenants. For this [multi-tenancy approach](/concepts/tenant-concept/multi-tenancy), the concept of the Enterprise Tenant was introduced.
