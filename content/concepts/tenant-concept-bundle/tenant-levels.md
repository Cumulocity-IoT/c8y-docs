The Cumulocity IoT tenant concept build a 3-level hierarchy:

At the bottom you can find a single tenant which is represented by the Standard Tenant, the basic package of the Cumulocity IoT offering. 

A Standard Tenant offers most of the device management functionality of the Cumulocity IoT platform, but shows certain limitations when it comes to administrative aspects. 

In a Standard Tenant, you separate multiple parties from each other by assigning access rights based on the roles concept, i.e. using roles, you can give certain users only restricted visibility of the tenant (for example, only the devices that belong to them). 


* You do not have access to the management tenant. Management on platform level is done by Cumulocity.


Moreover, a single tenant is represented by a subtenant of an Enterprise Tenant, see below.
