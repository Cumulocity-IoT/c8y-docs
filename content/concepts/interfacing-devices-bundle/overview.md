This section explains concepts relevant for interfacing IoT devices and other IoT-related data sources with Cumulocity.

To interface these systems with Cumulocity, a driver software called *agent* is required. We first describe the main tasks of an agent and discuss the structural options for agents later. We will walk step by step through the tasks of an agent. Finally, we discuss the usage of agents for acquiring data from other data sources such as a tenant's IT systems.

-   [Device SDK guide](/guides/device-sdk) for understanding in detail how to develop agent software using the REST or MQTT protocols.
-   [Rest implementation](/guides/reference/rest-implementation) in the Reference guide, for a detailed specification of the interfaces between agents and the Cumulocity core.
