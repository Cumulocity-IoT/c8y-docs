Application security addresses security at the software level.

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} follows standard practices for application-level hardening as making sure that only properly upgraded operating systems and web servers are in use. A number of additional "best practices" are employed to make {{< product-c8y-iot >}} secure by design.

* {{< product-c8y-iot >}} supports multiple types of authentication methods, applying the best practices for each type. For more details on each type see [Authentication](/authentication/basic-settings/).
  * "Basic authentication" features sessionless REST APIs. This means that none of the popular "session stealing" techniques will work with {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.
  * "OAI-Secure" provides high security, using authorization tokens to prove the identity of the user.
  * "Single sign-on" redirect enables the use of an external authorization provider.
* {{< product-c8y-iot >}} does not use a SQL database for IoT data storage and is itself not based on a scripting language. This means that so-called "injection attacks" will not work with {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.
* As discussed above, devices are clients at {{< product-c8y-iot >}} and therefore popular attacks to devices will not work.
* Devices are individually connected with {{< product-c8y-iot >}}'s device registration feature. This means that if a device is stolen or tampered with, it can be individually disconnected from {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

### Application management

* {{< product-c8y-iot >}} uses a versatile permission model, which consists of application access control and REST API access control. This allows to precisely define the access rules for a user.
* In the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform, the standard applications are configured by default following the best security practices.

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
Due to the very flexible nature of application management within {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, users can abuse certain security measures with sufficient permissions. For example, they can deploy a custom application with malicious code and make it available to the wide audience. Therefore, application management capabilities should be restricted to trusted and knowledgeable users.
