Cumulocity offers a wide range of functionality for interfacing IoT devices and other IoT-related data sources with the Cumulocity IoT platform.

We offer generic client libraries for [C++](/guides/device-sdk/cpp) and [C#](/guides/device-sdk/hello-mqtt-cs-0). If your device uses a completely proprietary runtime environment, you can always  use [MQTT](/guides/device-sdk/mqtt) and [SmartREST 2](/guides/device-sdk/rest). These will work on practically any Internet-connected device today, down to the smallest systems.

Detailed information on device integration using [MQTT](/guides/device-sdk/mqtt), [REST](/guides/device-sdk/rest), [C++](/guides/device-sdk/cpp) and [C#](/guides/device-sdk/hello-mqtt-cs-0) can be found in the [Device SDK guide](/guides/device-sdk/device-sdk-introduction).
