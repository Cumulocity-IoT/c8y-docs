{{< product-c8y-iot >}} offers a wide range of functionality for interfacing IoT devices and other IoT-related data sources with the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform.

We offer a generic client library for [C++](/device-integration/cpp). If your device uses a completely proprietary runtime environment, you can always use [MQTT](/device-integration/mqtt) and [SmartREST 2](/reference/smartrest-two). These will work on practically any internet-connected device today, down to the smallest systems.

Detailed information on device integration using [MQTT](/device-integration/mqtt/), [REST](/device-integration/rest) and [C++](/device-integration/cpp) can be found in the [Device SDK guide](/device-integration/device-integration-introduction).
