The functionality described above already provides a wide range of device management, visualization and control options. Furthermore it produces custom visualization, new control widgets and custom business logic. Cumulocity has extensive customization options, for example:

* Write alarm rules to reprioritize or suppress alarms and to define your SLA parameters.
* Use [real-time](/guides/concepts/realtime) to implement real-time business rules. For example, get an email when critical events happen, or trigger automated actions on devices in that case.
* Set up a graphical dashboard with your most important KPIs.
* Subscribe to plugins that contribute new functionality to the Cumulocity application.
