Tenants are physically separated data spaces with a separate URL, with a specific set of users, a separate application management and no sharing of data by default. Users in a single tenant share the same URL and the same data space.

For many scenarios it is sufficient to manage multiple parties within a single tenant. In this case, you [control the user access](/concepts/security/#access-control) by assigning appropriate roles - to specify which devices a user can see - and this way separate and protect multiple parties from each other. This approach corresponds to a [standard tenant](/concepts/tenant-concept/#standard-tenant) in Cumulocity IoT. 

For other scenarios this approach might not be sufficient for various reasons and it might be relevant to manage a portfolio of tenants. This [multi-tenancy approach](/concepts/tenant-concept/multi-tenancy), described in the next sections, is reflected by the the concept of [enterprise tenants](/concepts/tenant-concept/#enterprise-tenant) in Cumulocity IoT.
