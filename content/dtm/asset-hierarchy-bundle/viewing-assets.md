3. Optionally [add child assets](/dtm/asset-hierarchy/#to-add-child-assets), [assign devices](/dtm/asset-hierarchy/#to-assign-devices-to-an-asset) or [import assets](/dtm/asset-hierarchy/#creating-assets-bulk-import) from the top bar.

4. The asset name and description along with the icon are displayed at the top.

#### To view an asset hierarchy

To view an asset hierarchy:
