### Assets

In the DTM application assets are the digital representation of physical assets.
An asset in the DTM application can contain subassets and devices.
You also have the opportunity to define properties or parameters of an asset through [asset properties](/dtm/asset-types/#property-library).

To work with assets in the DTM application, navigate to the **Assets** page using the navigator on the left.
When you first start using the DTM application, no assets are displayed in the **Assets** page by default, instead you see a message is displayed prompting to create the assets.

If you already created assets, you find them listed with its hierarchy on this page (see image below).

### Asset hierarchy
An asset hierarchy is a structure that organizes multiple assets and devices into a hierarchy, allowing for the visualization and management of complex systems.

The asset hierarchy is displayed in the **Assets** page. An asset hierarchy consists of a root asset and all its subsequent child assets. Click **Add asset** to create the entire hierarchy of an asset in the **New asset** page. See next sections for more details.

**Example:**

If you create the root asset "Building" with the child asset "Floor", which has the child asset "Room", then the hierarchy would be displayed as follows:

Building > Floor > Room

Initially, all the asset hierarchies are collapsed and you see only the root assets listed. You also see some of the asset details like, asset model and last modified date in the list. Click the expand icon to the left of each asset to view the next level of child assets.

Use **Expand all** or **Collapse all** in the top bar to expand or collapse all asset hierarchy levels. 

Select the checkbox next to the desired asset to perform desired actions on multiple assets at once.

Click on asset name to view the asset details.
