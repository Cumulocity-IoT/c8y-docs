Additionally, if you want to add translations for the [custom property](/dtm/asset-types/#property-library) or [asset types](/dtm/asset-types/#asset-types) created, or if you want to add custom translations for the existing static text in the DTM application, same can be done using the **Localization** feature.

![Main view localization page](/images/dtm/localization/dtm-localozation-main-page.png)

Initially, the **Localization** page will show a row called **Group** as key. If necessary, add a translation for "group" according to the explanation above.

Once you create all custom properties and asset types, then all those names are added as keys in the **Localization** page. You can further add the translations as required.

To add a new translation in the DTM application, you can add the text as key and add the translations as required.

### To add new keys for translations

Add new keys and their respective translations using the **Add term** option on the top right.

Fill all the mandatory fields in the dialog window and click **Save**. The new key is saved including the added translations.

Next, click **Apply** to apply the changes.

### To add and edit translations

 You can add or edit translations for all the keys in two ways:

* Hover over the respective column for the edit icon to be visible. Click the icon to select the desired language and add or edit the translation.

* Click the edit icon in each row to open the dialog window **Edit term translations**. Add or edit the translation for any language. Click **Save** to finish the process.

The edit icon is present for each row and click **Edit term translations** dialog window loads.

Translation can be added or modified for any of the languages and the changes can be saved using **Save** button.


Once all your translations are in place, change the language under **User settings**. For more information see [Getting started > User options and settings > To change user settings](/users-guide/getting-started/#gui-features) in the *User guide*.


The added translations will now be displayed in the DTM application.

To change the language for the DTM application click the **User settings** option under [User button](/users-guide/getting-started/#gui-features) and select the desired language in the dropdown menu. You need to refresh your screen for the application to display the newly selected language.
