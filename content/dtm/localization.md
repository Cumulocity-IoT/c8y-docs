The **Localization** feature is provided in the DTM application. To use this feature, subscribe to [Feature branding](/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/#branding) in the [Enterprise tenant](/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/#overview). It should then appear under [Subscribed applications](/users-guide/administration/#subscribed-applications) in your tenant.

Once you have enabled feature branding, open the **Localization** page on the left menu.

To change the language for the DTM application click the **User settings** option under [User button](/users-guide/getting-started/#gui-features) and select the desired language in the dropdown menu. You need to refresh your screen for the application to display the newly selected language.

Additionally, if you want to add translations for the [custom property](/dtm/asset-types/#property-library) or [asset types](/dtm/asset-types/#asset-types) created, or if you want to add custom translations for the existing static text in the DTM application, same can be done using the **Localization** feature.

On your first time login, the **Localization** page will show a row named **Group** as key. If necessary, add a translation for "group" according to the explanation above.

Once you create all custom properties and asset types, then all those names are added as keys in the **Localization** page. You can further add the translations as required.

In case you want to add new translation in the DTM application, same can be done by adding the text as key and adding the required translation for the respective languages.

### To add new keys for translations

Add new keys and their respective translations using the **Add term** option on the top right.

Next, click **Apply** to apply the changes.

### To add and edit translations

 You can add or edit translations for all the keys in two ways:

* Hover over the respective column for the edit icon to be visible. Click the icon to select the desired language and add or edit the translation.

* Click the edit icon in each row to open the dialog window **Edit term translations**. Add or edit the translation for any language. Click **Save** to finish the process.

The edit icon is present for each row and click **Edit term translations** dialog window loads.

Translation can be added or modified for any of the languages and the changes can be saved using **Save** button.


Once all your translations are in place, change the language under **User settings**. The added translations will now be displayed in the DTM application.
