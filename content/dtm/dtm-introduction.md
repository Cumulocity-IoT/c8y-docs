Welcome to the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Digital Twin Manager (DTM) web app.

This web app allows you to create and manage assets around your physical connected devices in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} using a digital representation of a physical hierarchy of assets and devices. Here, assets can be used to structure and describe devices in logical hierarchies as encountered in the real world environment to help with visualizing the hierarchy in a digital setting.

Once the asset hierarchy is created in the DTM web app, the hierarchy can be applied to other web apps such as OEE or Machine portal. It would save a lot of time and efforts, as the hierarchy is created only once and can be used directly in other {{< product-c8y-iot >}} hosted web apps.

Devices for the DTM web app are created using the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Device Management web app.
For more details on the Device Management web app, see [Device Management > Connecting devices > Device registration](/users-guide/device-management/#connecting-devices) in the *User guide*.

Assets are created in the DTM web app using asset types as the blueprint for assets. An asset type consists of one or more custom properties and subassets.

The DTM web app also provides a localization feature to customize the translation for certain content. See [Localization](/dtm/localization) for more information on this feature.
