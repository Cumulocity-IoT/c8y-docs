Welcome to the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Digital Twin Manager (DTM) application.

The Digital Twin Manager (DTM) application allows you to create and manage assets around your physical connected devices in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} using a digital representation of a physical hierarchy of assets and devices. Here, assets can be used to structure and describe devices in logical hierarchies as encountered in the real world environment to help with visualizing the hierarchy in a digital setting.

Once the asset hierarchy is created in the DTM application, the hierarchy can be applied to other applications such as OEE or Machine portal. It would save a lot of time and efforts, as the hierarchy is created only once and can be used directly in other {{< product-c8y-iot >}} hosted applications.

Devices for the DTM application are created using the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Device Management application.
For more details on the Device Management application, see [Device Management](/users-guide/device-management/#connecting-devices) in the *User guide*.

Assets are created in the DTM application using asset types as the blueprint for assets. An asset type consists of one or more custom properties and subassets.

The DTM application also provides a localization feature, where you can customize and display the translation for certain content. See [ADD HYPERLINK TO TRANSLATIONS HERE]().
