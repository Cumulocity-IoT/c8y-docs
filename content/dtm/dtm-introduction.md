  content: "The DTM application allows you to create and manage assets around your physical connected devices in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} through the digital representation of a physical hierarchy of assets and devices.


  To create an asset, use asset types as the blueprint, which consist of one or more custom properties as well as one or more child asset types.  


  An asset hierarchy consist of a root asset type followed by all its subsequent child asset types. Each hierarchy level can consist of custom properties for the asset, as well as its subassets and devices.


  To get started, open the **Digital twin library** in the **Configuration** menu in the navigator and create the necessary asset types and custom properties. Afterwards, navigate to the **Assets** menu in the navigator and click **Add asset** on the top right corner to create the assets. "

Welcome to the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Digital Twin Manager (DTM) application.

This application allows you to create and manage assets around your physical connected devices in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} using a digital representation of a physical hierarchy of assets and devices. Here, assets can be used to structure and describe devices in logical hierarchies as encountered in the real world environment to help with visualizing the hierarchy in a digital setting.

Once the asset hierarchy is created in the DTM application, the hierarchy can be applied to other applications such as OEE or Machine portal. It saves a lot of time and effort, as the hierarchy is created only once and can be used directly in other {{< product-c8y-iot >}} hosted applications.
