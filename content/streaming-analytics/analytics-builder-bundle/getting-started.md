### What is Analytics Builder

Analytics Builder allows you to build analytic models that transform or analyze streaming data in order to generate new data or output events. The models are capable of processing data in real time.

You build the models in a graphical environment by combining pre-built blocks into models. The blocks in a model package up small bits of logic, and have a number of inputs, outputs and parameters. Each block implements a specific piece of functionality, such as receiving data from a sensor, performing a calculation, detecting a condition, or generating an output signal. You define the configuration of the blocks and connect the blocks using wires. You can edit the models, simulate deployment with historic data, or run them against live systems. See [Understanding models](/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/#understanding-models) for more detailed information.

Analytics Builder consists of the following tools:

-   Model manager. When you invoke Analytics Builder, the model manager is shown first. It lists all available models and lets you manage them. For example, you can test and deploy the models from the model manager, or you can duplicate or remove them. You can create new models or edit existing models; in this case, the model editor is invoked. Samples are also available which help you get started with creating your own models. See [Using the model manager](/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/#using-the-model-manager) for detailed information.
-   Model editor. The model editor lets you define the blocks that are used within a model and how they are wired together. User-visible documentation \(the so-called *Block Reference*\) is available in the model editor, describing the functionality of each block. See [Using the model editor](/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/#using-the-model-editor) for detailed information.
-   Instance editor. If template parameters have been defined in a model, the instance editor lets you set up different instances of the same model which can then be activated and managed separately. The instance editor uses the template parameters that have been defined in the model editor. See [Using the instance editor](/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/#using-the-instance-editor) for detailed information.

The blocks are implemented in the Event Processing Language \(EPL\) of Apama. At runtime, the EPL code runs in an Apama correlator to execute the models. Some runtime behavior and restrictions are important to understand. These are documented in later chapters.

### Analytics Builder and Cumulocity IoT

Devices and sensors can be connected to Cumulocity IoT. See [Interfacing devices](/concepts/interfacing-devices/) in the *Concepts guide* and [Device integration using MQTT](/device-integration/mqtt/) in the *Device Integration* guide.

Sensors result in `Measurement` or `Event` objects in Cumulocity IoT, and devices can receive `Operation` objects created within the Cumulocity IoT platform. All of these objects \(`Measurement`, `Event`, `Operation`\) will be associated with a single device in the Cumulocity IoT platform. A device may have multiple types of measurement associated with it, and the types of measurements each device supports may be the same as other devices or different to other devices. Once devices are connected to Cumulocity IoT, information about these devices is stored in the Cumulocity IoT inventory. These are visible in the Device Management application, which can also be used to view `Measurement`, `Event` or `Operation` objects associated with that device. See [Device management](/users-guide/device-management/) in the *User guide* for more information.

The Cumulocity IoT platform includes an Apama correlator component, which is managed by the Cumulocity IoT platform \(this is not manually started or stopped\) and is preconfigured to communicate to Cumulocity IoT. This correlator hosts the Analytics Builder runtime, and also executes any custom Apama rules added using EPL apps.

Analytics Builder allows you to create models that interact with the devices and sensor measurements. Models can receive `Measurement` and `Event` objects from devices, which provide the inputs to calculations or pattern detection performed within a model. Models can create new `Measurement` objects which can represent derived values from sensors \(for example, an average temperature\) or the measurements can be used as an input to other analytic models \(see [Connections between models](/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/#connections-between-models)\). Models can create new `Operation` objects which are sent to devices to control the devices \(for example, to sound an alarm bell, display a message on a screen, or switch a device off\). The models are also stored in the Cumulocity IoT inventory, but can be imported or exported via the model manager.

Business logic can also be written in Apamaâ€™s Event Processing Language \(Apama EPL\) which gives more power and flexibility in a text-based programming language. This is an alternative if more complex logic is required or the logic does not fit into the pattern of an analytic model. EPL apps can be written directly in the Streaming Analytics application. See [EPL Apps](/streaming-analytics/epl-apps/) for more information, including examples. Alternatively, it is also possible to build custom blocks if none of the blocks delivered with Analytics Builder implement the logic required; see [Creating your own blocks](/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/#creating-your-own-blocks).

Analytics Builder can be used with both Cumulocity IoT Core \(cloud\) and Cumulocity IoT Edge \(local installation\). You can customize several aspects of Analytics Builder by setting various tenant options. See [Configuration](/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/#configuration) for detailed information.


### Prerequisites

#### Browsers

Analytics Builder supports the same browsers as Cumulocity IoT, with the following exception: browsers on smartphones and tablets are not supported.

#### Permissions

To use Analytics Builder in Cumulocity IoT, you must at least have the following permissions:

|Permission type|Permission level|
|---------------|----------------|
|CEP management|ADMIN|
|Option management|READ|
|Inventory|READ|

This is typically achieved by using a global role which has those permissions, and where the role has access to the Analytics Builder application. See [Administration > Managing permissions](/users-guide/administration/#managing-permissions) in the *User guide* for details.

#### Microservice

To use Analytics Builder, you need the Apama-ctrl microservice in Cumulocity IoT.

Your tenant may be subscribed to the Apama-ctrl-starter microservice, in which case you are limited to at most 3 active analytic models. Custom blocks written with the Analytics Builder Block SDK cannot be used with Apama-ctrl-starter. Contact Software AG support to discuss adding more capabilities.

If your tenant is subscribed to the Apama-ctrl-smartrules microservice, Analytics Builder is not available.

### Language settings

The language in which the user interface of Analytics Builder is shown depends on your user settings in Cumulocity IoT. See [Getting Started > User options and settings](/users-guide/getting-started/#user-settings) in the *User guide* for more information.

If Cumulocity IoT or the browser is set to a language that is currently not supported by Analytics Builder, the user interface is shown with the default language, which is English.

### First Steps: Creating your first model

This topic gives a brief overview of how to add and design a new model, and how to view its output. It is not intended to be a comprehensive description of the full range of possibilities provided by Analytics Builder. Therefore, explanations are kept to a minimum. For more detailed information, see the remainder of this documentation.

The steps below require that a device has already been registered in Cumulocity IoT. Preferably, this is a device which is already sending measurement values to Cumulocity IoT. This can be, for example, a smartphone on which the Cumulocity IoT Sensor App has been installed \(see [Cumulocity IoT Sensor App](/users-guide/sensor-app/) in the *User guide* for detailed information\).

The model that you add will contain three blocks:

-   An input block which receives measurement values from a device.
-   A block that calculates the mean of the measurement values over time.
-   An output block that sends the calculated mean values to Cumulocity IoT's Device Management application so that they can be viewed there.

When you have completed all steps below, your model will look similar to the following:

![Completed model with three blocks](/images/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/first-steps.png)

#### Step 1: Switch to Analytics Builder

-  On the home screen of the Streaming Analytics application, click the **Open** button that is shown below the Analytics Builder heading.

   Or click **Analytics Builder** in the navigator on the left.

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
If the navigator is currently hidden, click the small arrow at the very left of the top bar to toggle the display of the navigator.
{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

#### Step 2: Add a new model

The first page that is shown when you invoke Analytics Builder is the model manager.

1.  On the **Models** tab, click **New model** in the toolbar.

2.  In the resulting dialog box, enter a model name and click **OK**.

#### Step 3: Add the input block

You design your model in the model editor. The model editor is shown after you have entered the model name. The palette which is shown on the left contains all blocks that can be added to a model. You add a block by dragging it from the palette onto the canvas. The blocks for the input devices that have been registered in Cumulocity IoT are shown under **Input**.

1.  In the palette, expand **Input**.

2.  Drag the **Measurement Input** block onto the canvas.

    The block parameter editor is automatically shown.

    {{< c8y-admon-info>}}
If the block parameter editor is not shown (for example, because you clicked an empty space on the canvas after dragging the input block onto the canvas), click the block using the left mouse button to show the block parameter editor.
    {{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

3.  Click the three dots that are shown for **Input Source**. In the resulting dialog box, click the **Use** button to select your device. This button is shown when you move the mouse over a device.

4.  From the **Fragment and Series** drop-down list box, select the fragment and series for which the input block is to listen.

    If the device has previously sent data, the drop-down list box offers one or more values for selection. An example for the Cumulocity IoT Sensor App would be **c8y\_Gyroscope =\> gyroscopeY**.

5.  Select the **Ignore Timestamp** check box.

    This makes sure that the measurements are processed in the same order as they are received.

If you need detailed information on the currently selected block, view the block reference in the documentation pane on the right. If the documentation pane is currently not shown, click the following icon:

![Document icon](/images/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/icon-docpane-hidden.png)


#### Step 4: Add the block that calculates the mean of the measurement values

1.  In the palette, expand **Aggregate**.
2.  Drag the **Average \(Mean\)** block onto the canvas.
3.  In the block parameter editor, specify a value for **Window Duration \(secs\)**, for example "10".

    The specified number of seconds will be used to control what duration the measurement is averaged over. Smaller values will react quicker to changes in values, larger values will give more smoothing of the value.


#### Step 5: Add the output block

1.  In the palette, expand **Output**.

2.  Drag the **Measurement Output** block onto the canvas.

3.  As the output destination, select the same device as for your input block.

4.  Specify "apama\_Average" as the fragment name.

5.  Specify "value" as the series name.

#### Step 6: Connect the blocks

To pass the values from one block to another, you have to connect the blocks with wires. You attach the wires to the ports, that is, to the small circles that are shown to the left and/or right of a block.

1.  Click the **Value** output port of the input block and drag the mouse to the **Value** input port of the **Average \(Mean\)** block.

2.  Click the **Average** output port of the **Average \(Mean\)** block and drag the mouse to the **Value** input port of the output block.

#### Step 7: Save the model and go back to the model manager

1.  In the toolbar of the model editor, click the following icon to save your newly created model:
    ![Save icon](/images/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/icon-save.png)

2.  In the toolbar of the model editor, click the following icon to leave the model editor and thus to return to the model manager:
    ![Close icon](/images/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/icon-exit.png)

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
Only saved models are listed on the **Models** tab of the model manager. When you add a new model and then leave the model editor without saving the model, it will not be listed in the model manager, and all the edits you made will be lost.
{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

#### Step 8: Activate the model in production mode

A card for the newly added model is shown on the **Models** tab of the model manager. A new model is automatically set to draft mode and inactive state. You will now activate your new model in production mode. This deploys the model so that the measurements from your device are processed.

1.  Click the drop-down menu on the card which currently shows **Draft** and select **Production**.

2.  Click the toggle button on the card which currently shows **Inactive**. This changes the state to **Active**.

#### Step 9: Go to the Device Management and view the measurements

To view the measurements that are sent from your active model, you have to switch to the Device Management application. See [Device Management](/users-guide/device-management/) in the *User guide* for detailed information.

1.  Go to the Device Management application.

2.  In the navigator on the left, click **Devices** and then **All devices**.

3.  Locate your device and click its name to display the device details.

4.  Click **Measurements** on the left. This is a dynamic tab which is only shown when measurements are available for the device.

    The resulting page shows several charts, visualizing the data sent from your device. It should now also show a chart titled "Apama\_average" in which you can view the values that are sent from your newly created model. You may have to reload the page to see this new chart. See [Device Management > Device details > Measurements](/users-guide/device-management/#measurements) in the *User guide* for more information on the **Measurements** tab.


### First Steps: Creating a model from a sample

This topic gives a brief overview of how to create a model from a sample. It is based on the **On missing measurements create alarm** sample. Your new model will create an alarm if no new measurement data has been received for a specified time period.

This topic is not intended to be a comprehensive description of the full range of possibilities provided by Analytics Builder. Therefore, explanations are kept to a minimum. For more detailed information, see the remainder of this documentation.

The steps below require that a device has already been registered in Cumulocity IoT. Preferably, this is a device which is already sending measurement values to Cumulocity IoT. This can be, for example, a smartphone on which the Cumulocity IoT Sensor App has been installed \(see [Cumulocity IoT Sensor App](/users-guide/sensor-app/) in the *User guide* for detailed information\).

The following image shows the blocks that are defined in the **On missing measurements create alarm** sample.

![Blocks defined within the sample](/images/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/first-steps-sample.png)

The sample uses predefined template parameters. After you have created a model from the sample, you can create multiple instances of the model and you can specify different values for the template parameters. See also [Models](/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/#models) which explains the difference between models without template parameters and models with template parameters.

The following is a brief description of the blocks that are defined within the sample:

-   The input starts with the **Measurement Input** block waiting for new incoming measurements that match a given value that is defined with the **Input fragment and series** template parameter. The name of that parameter is the label that you can see on the input block.
-   The output from the **Measurement Input** block is then passed to the **Missing Data** block which triggers an output if no input is received within the time defined with the **Duration \(seconds\)** template parameter.
-   The output from the **Missing Data** block is used as the trigger for the **Create Alarm** input port of the **Alarm Output** block. The name of the **Alarm type** template parameter is the label that you can see on the output block.
-   The output from the **Measurement Input** block is also passed as input to the **Object** input port of the **Text Substitution** block, along with the input from the **Managed Object Input** block which is passed to the **Source** input port of the **Text Substitution** block. The name of the **Device or group of devices** template parameter is the label that you can see on the input block.
-   The **Text Substitution** block supports replacement of placeholders. For example, if the input text is "Missing measurements of type: \#\{type\}", then the `#{type}` value is replaced by the actual `type` of the measurement. See [Text Substitution](/streaming-analytics/block-reference/#text-substitution) for more details.
-   The **Text Substitution** block is configured to use the **Alarm text** template parameter as user input. It applies the required substitutions and then sends the string containing the substitutions from its **Output** output port to the **Message** input port of the **Alarm Output** block.
-   The **Alarm Output** block requires the **Alarm type** and **Alarm severity** template parameters to be configured and creates an alarm whenever it is triggered by the **Missing Data** block.

#### Step 1: Create a new model from a sample

The **Samples** tab of the model manager lists all sample models that are provided with Analytics Builder. You can view a sample by simply clicking on its card, but you cannot edit or deploy it. However, you can use the samples as a basis for developing your own models, by creating a model from a sample.

1.  Go to the **Samples** tab of the model manager.

2.  Click the actions menu of the **On missing measurements create alarm** sample and then click **Create model from sample**.

    The new model is immediately shown in the model editor. It has the same name, description and tags as the sample.

3.  If you want to rename the model, click the model name which is shown at the left of the toolbar. You can then specify a new name in the resulting **Model Configuration** dialog box.

4.  In the toolbar of the model editor, click the following icon to save the new model:
    ![Save icon](/images/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/icon-save.png)

5.  In the toolbar of the model editor, click the following icon to leave the model editor and thus to return to the model manager:
    ![Save icon](/images/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/icon-exit.png)

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
Keep in mind that only saved models are listed on the **Models** tab of the model manager.
{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

#### Step 2: Create a new instance of the model

The sample model uses template parameters. So when you turn the sample into a model, you create a so-called template model. You cannot activate a template model directly in the model manager. Instead, you must create at least one instance of the model, and you can then activate that instance using the instance editor.

1.  On the **Models** tab of the model manager, locate the card for your newly created model.

2.  To invoke the instance editor, click **0 Instances** which is currently shown on the card.

3.  Click **New Instance** to create the first instance of your new model.

#### Step 3: Fill in the template parameter values

In the instance editor, a row is shown for each instance that you create. A column is provided for each template parameter that is defined in the template model, with the name of the template parameter being the column header. As long as an instance is not active, you can adjust the values for that instance.

![Instance table with one instance](/images/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/first-steps-instance-editor.png)

Use the horizontal scroll bar below the instance table if not all template parameters \(columns\) are shown on the screen.

1.  Click the field below the **Device or group of devices** column header. In the resulting dialog, select the device or group of devices that you want to use for this instance and click **Use**.

2.  In the text box below the **Input fragment and series** column header, specify the details of the measurement input that you want to monitor in the following format:

    `<valueFragmentName>.<valueSeriesName>`

    For example, if the measurement fragment is `c8y_Gyroscope` and the series is `gyroscopeX`, then you must enter the following:

    `c8y_Gyroscope.gyroscopeX`

    {{< c8y-admon-tip>}}
If you want to find out which fragments and series are available to your device, without changing the predefined template parameters of the **Measurement Input** block, go back to the model editor, drag the input block for your device from the palette onto the canvas and open the **Fragment and Series** drop-down list box. This lists all the values that you can use. However, instead of the `=>` that you can see in the drop-down list box, you have to use a dot \(.\) in this case. Don't forget to remove this block again after you have decided which value to use.
    {{< /c8y-admon-tip>}}

3.  The fields below the **Duration \(seconds\)**, **Alarm type**, **Alarm text** and **Alarm severity** column headers already contain default values \(see also the above description of the blocks\). Adapt them to your requirements. For example, change the duration to 30 seconds, rename the alarm type to "MyAlarmType", keep the predefined alarm text, and set the alarm severity to **Minor**.

4.  In the toolbar of the instance editor, click **Save**.

#### Step 4: Activate the instance

You will now activate the instance in production mode. This deploys the instance so that the measurements from your device are processed.

1.  In the **Run Mode** column of the instance editor, click the drop-down menu for the instance and select **Production**.

2.  In the **Status** column of the instance editor, click the button which currently shows **Inactive** to change the status to **Active**.

#### Step 5: Send in the data from your device

Once the instance has been activated, send in the data from your device. The instance starts monitoring the device once measurement data starts arriving and creates an alarm if no data is received within the configured duration.

For our example case with the gyroscope measurements from a smartphone, it should be sufficient that you simply turn off the smartphone display while the Cumulocity IoT Sensor App is still running.

#### Step 6: Go to the Device Management and view the alarms

To view the alarms that are sent from your active instance, you have to switch to the Device Management application.
See [Device Management](/users-guide/device-management/) in the *User guide* for detailed information.

1.  Go to the Device Management application.

2.  In the navigator on the left, click **Devices** and then **All devices**.

3.  Locate your device and click its name to display the device details.

4.  Click **Alarms** on the left.

5.  On the resulting page, check the alarms that are sent from your device. If you have edited your instance as described above, you should see a MINOR alarm after 30 seconds, saying "Missing measurements of type: c8y\_Gyroscope". See [Monitoring and controlling devices > Working with alarms](/users-guide/device-management/#alarm-monitoring) in the *User guide* for more information on the **Alarms** tab.
