**TODO: Generated from the developers' .mon files, but this time in Markdown (instead of DITA).**

*We need to decide whether to have the block reference in a bundle of its own (with better visibility in the table of contents)
or whether to include this in the analytics-builder-bundle (where the resultung HTML page is already far too long).*


See also my thoughts on the iWiki page.

Right now, this HTML page only contains the headings of all the topics that are to be included.

With the current test draft, the block reference is shown in 2 different places. See also the "Block reference" entry under "Analytics Builder" in the table of contents. When a decision has been taken, we need to remove it in one of these 2 places.
