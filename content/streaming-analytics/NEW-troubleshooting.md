Re-using the apama/troubleshooting-bundle here. No need to change the contents of this section.

**TODO:**
- Replace all of the files in here with the latest from "apama".
- Had to rename the control file and bundle name to include "NEW" because Hugo protested about ambiguity. Revert the renaming once the "apama" folder has been deleted.
- Do not delete the text below from this file.

If you have the Apama-ctrl-smartrules or Apama-ctrl-smartrulesmt microservice, most of the functionality described in this topic does not apply.
