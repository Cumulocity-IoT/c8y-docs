There are two ways to get the logs of the Apama-ctrl microservice:

- You can download diagnostics information from the Streaming Analytics application as described in [Downloading diagnostics and logs](#diagnostics-download).
- In some cases, it is useful to view the log file of the Apama-ctrl microservice directly in {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.
  The log file is accessible via the Administration application. You can find it on the **Logs** tab of the Apama-ctrl microservice. You have to subscribe to the microservice so that you can see the logs. For more information on microservices and log files, see [Managing microservices](/standard-tenant/ecosystem/#managing-microservices) and [Monitoring microservices](/standard-tenant/ecosystem/#monitoring-microservices).

    {{< c8y-admon-info >}}
  In case of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge, since Apama-ctrl is not deployed as a microservice in Edge, the log file can be retrieved using the diagnostic utility. For more details, see [Apama log file locations](/edge/operating-edge/#apama-log-file-locations) and [Diagnostic utility](/edge/operating-edge/#diagnostics).
