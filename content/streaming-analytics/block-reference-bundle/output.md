### Alarm Output

**apama.analyticskit.blocks.cumulocity.CreateAlarm**

Creates a new <tt>Alarm</tt> object for a specified device, asset or for the trigger device with a pre-configured alarm name and parameters.

This block produces synchronous output. The parameters that define the output stream are "Output Destination" and "Alarm Type". Using another instance of this block with the same output stream is not allowed.


If "Create Alarm" is provided repeatedly, then the count of the alarm is increased (unless it has been cleared). If the severity has changed, then the count is not increased - the existing alarm is modified instead.


The default behavior of the Alarm Output block is to produce a synchronous output and the Analytics Builder framework explicitly disallows models that can cause a loop when synchronous outputs are produced. However, such validations are disabled when asynchronous outputs are produced. Therefore, special care must be taken when using the Create Asynchronous Output parameter. This may result in infinite loops during model execution (for the same model or across multiple models), leading to performance degradation or the application running out of memory. For example, a loop can occur if the model consumes an alarm input of a given type and produces an alarm output of the same type for the same device; the output generated by the model is then consumed by the same model as an input, resulting in a loop.

#### Parameters

|Name|Description|Type|Notes|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Output Destination|The device (or for models handling group of devices, trigger device or asset) that the alarm is associated with. Assets can be used only for sending cross-device aggregates.<br><br>The model editor uses the device name. This is mapped internally to the device identifier.|any|
|Alarm Type|Identifies the type of this alarm, for example "com_cumulocity_events_TamperEvent".|string|
|Message|The text that is displayed if the alarm is triggered. The message is set either by parameter or input. If both are not set, the model name is used. You cannot set both.|string|Optional|
|Severity|The severity of the alarm. The severity is set either by this parameter or the input port. You must set only one of them.|Option - one of:<ul><li>Critical</li><li>Major</li><li>Minor</li><li>Warning</li></ul>|Optional|
|Params Fragment|If this parameter is set, then the incoming properties on the Properties input port are added to this fragment in the generated <tt>Alarm</tt>. If this is not set, the properties are copied to the top level of the <tt>Alarm</tt> params.|string|Optional|
|Create Asynchronous Output|Allow Create Alarm or Clear Alarm to be done asynchronously.<br><br>Asynchronous output events are events that do not have source timestamps and can only be consumed by another model in a time-asynchronous manner when they are received back from the platform.
<br><br>
Caution: The default behavior of the Alarm Output block is to produce a synchronous output and the Analytics Builder framework explicitly disallows models that can cause a loop when synchronous outputs are produced. However, such validations are disabled when asynchronous outputs are being produced. Therefore, special care must be taken when using the Create Asynchronous Output parameter. This may result in infinite loops during model execution (for the same model or across multiple models), leading to performance degradation or the application running out of memory. For example, a loop can occur if the model consumes an alarm input of type <tt>foo</tt> and produces an alarm output of type <tt>foo</tt> for the same device; the output generated by the model is then again consumed by the same model as an input, resulting in a loop.|boolean|Optional|

#### Input Port Details

|Name|Description|Type|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Create Alarm|Creates an alarm when a signal is received and a severity value is set.|pulse|

### Event Output

**apama.analyticskit.blocks.cumulocity.CreateEvent**

Creates a new <tt>Event</tt> object for a specified device, asset or for the trigger device.

The text of the event is determined by the Text Input input port or by the Message parameter. You must not set both. If neither are set, the model name is used as the text.


This block produces synchronous output. The parameters that define the output stream of the block are "Output Destination" and "Event Type". Using another instance of this block with the same output stream is not allowed.

#### Parameters

|Name|Description|Type|Notes|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Output Destination|The device (or for models handling group of devices, trigger device or asset) to which the event is to be sent. Assets can be used only for sending cross-device aggregates.<br><br>The model editor uses the current device name. This is mapped internally to the device identifier.|any|
|Event Type|Identifies the type of this event.|string|
|Message|The text that will be displayed when the event is created.<br><br>This requires that the Text Input input is not connected. If neither are set, the model name is used as the text.|string|Optional|
|Params Fragment|If this parameter is set, then the incoming properties on the Properties input port are added to this fragment in the generated <tt>Event</tt>. If this is not set, the properties are copied to the top level of the <tt>Event</tt> params.|string|Optional|

#### Input Port Details

### Managed Object Output

**apama.analyticskit.blocks.cumulocity.ManagedObjectOutput**

Updates a <tt>ManagedObject</tt> object for a specified device, asset or for the trigger device.

If the Property Name parameter is set, then the Value input port (or its properties if it has an empty value) is used to set that property on the managed object.


If the Property Name parameter is not set, then all properties from the Value input port are used to update the managed object.


Note: The following reference properties on a managed object cannot be updated using this block: <tt>childDeviceIds</tt>, <tt>childAssetIds</tt>, <tt>deviceParentIds</tt> and <tt>assetParentIds</tt>.


This block does not participate in time-synchronous model-to-model communication. Multiple blocks can be used in a single model or multiple models to update the same property of the same device. Cycles among models can be formed because of this block, so care must be taken not to introduce indefinite cyclic execution of models.


This block produces asynchronous output. The parameter that defines the output stream of the block is "Output Destination".

#### Parameters

|Name|Description|Type|Notes|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Output Destination|The device (or for models handling group of devices, trigger device or asset) that the managed object is associated with. Assets can be used only for sending cross-device aggregates.<br><br>The model editor uses the current device name. This is mapped internally to the device identifier.|any|
|Property Name|The name of the property to update.<br><br>If not set, then the properties from the Value input port are mapped to the top level properties of the managed object.|string|Optional|

#### Input Port Details

|Name|Description|Type|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Value|The value of the property to set.|any|
|Update Property|Signals that the property is to be updated. If not connected, every new value from the Value input port updates the property.|pulse|



### Measurement Output

**apama.analyticskit.blocks.cumulocity.CreateMeasurement**

Creates a new <tt>Measurement</tt> object for a specified device, asset or for the trigger device.

This block sends a new measurement for the Value input port. If the Send input port is connected, this block only sends an output on receiving a send signal.  The measurement is sent to the current device or the device specified.


This block produces synchronous output. The parameters that define the output stream of the block are "Output Destination", "Fragment Name" and "Series Name". Using another instance of this block with the same output stream is not allowed.


Non-finite values are ignored.

#### Parameters

|Name|Description|Type|Notes|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Output Destination|The device (or for models handling group of devices, trigger device or asset) to which the measurement is to be sent.

### Operation Output

**apama.analyticskit.blocks.cumulocity.CreateOperationStaticValue**

Creates a new <tt>Operation</tt> object for a specified device, asset or for the trigger device.

If none of the Operation Name, Parameter Name or Parameter Value parameters are set, then the operation will use the Properties input port to populate the <tt>Operation</tt> object.


The block does not participate in time-synchronous model-to-model communication. Multiple blocks can be used in a single model or multiple models to create new operations for the same device. Cycles among models can be formed because of this block, so care must be taken not to introduce indefinite cyclic execution of models.


The block produces asynchronous output. The parameter that defines the output stream of the block is "Output Destination".
