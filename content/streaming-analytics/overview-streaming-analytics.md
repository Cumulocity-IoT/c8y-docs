**TODO in this entire new guide:**

- Copy over all of the files from the old "apama" directory
in order to replace the files in this new directory with the latest updates.

- Remove the old "apama" directory when everything has been copied over.

- Adapt all links that go to the PAB webhelp.

- Make sure to use shortcodes in the converted Analytics Builder doc.

- Also create a new static/images/streaming-analytics folder and remove the old apama folder in there later.
Add a prefix to the existing images (EplApp) and copy over all of the AnaBui images.
Change all of the (existing) image links to point to the new location.

The topics below are from the apama/overview-analytics-bundle. No need to restructure this. Just copy over the most recent stuff from the "apama" directory.
