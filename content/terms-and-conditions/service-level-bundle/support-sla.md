### Incident Processing

#### Request submission

All incidents must be reported through the Provider’s Support Portal. A reference number will be issued for tracking purposes. For Crisis Incidents, the Customer must report by telephone and indicate whether the incident involves security concerns.  The respective telephone number is available in Provider's Support Portal. If not provided in local language, telephone support is provided in English. Telephone support is provided during after-Business Hours and on non-Business Days in English only.

#### Incident classification

Incidents are classified into three levels of severity:

* Crisis Incidents: Customer’s problem has a severe business impact, e.g. production down. Customer is unable to use the Cloud Services, resulting in a major impact on Customer’s operations. Work cannot reasonably continue.
* Critical Incidents: Customer’s problem has a significant business impact; however, operations can continue in a restricted fashion. The Cloud Services are usable but severely limited. There is no acceptable workaround available. Customer is experiencing a significant loss of service.
* Standard Incidents: Customer’s problem has some business impact. The Cloud Services are usable and cause only minor inconvenience. It may be a minor Error, documentation Error, or incorrect operation of the Cloud Services, which does not significantly impede the operation of the Cloud Service.

### Customer Responsibilities

Customer assigns ATCs and communicates any changes to the list of ATCs to Provider. When an incident is submitted by an ATC to Provider's Support Portal, Customer authorizes Supplier, for the purposes of troubleshooting and resolving such incident, to access Customer’s cloud environment for the duration of the submitted incident. Customer's ATC is responsible for cooperating with Provider's Global Support and providing necessary information to troubleshoot and resolve issues.
