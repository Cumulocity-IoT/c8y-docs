* **Cloud Services**: Provider's cloud services as specified in the Cloud Services order form.
* **Error**: Any verifiable and reproducible failure of the Cloud Services to substantially conform to the specifications for such Cloud Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ”Error” shall not include any such failure that is caused by:

  2. modifications to the Cloud Services not made or approved by the Provider in writing, or
  3. any bug, defect, or error in third-party software used with the Cloud Services.
* **Error Correction**:  A modification, addition, or deletion that brings the Cloud Services into substantial conformance with specifications or reduces the adverse effect of the Error. It may include a workaround, service update, or solution provided by the Provider.

Shared group accounts are not allowed.
* **Global Support**: The Provider’s Global Support Organization responsible for delivering maintenance and support services to the Customer.
* **Support Portal**: The Provider’s web-based support system that provides access to information, documentation and Error Corrections, and permits browsing and submitting incidents.

### Incident classification

Global Support will classify incidents into three levels of severity according to the following table:

* **Crisis Incidents**: Customer’s problem has a severe business impact, e.g. production down. Customer is unable to use the Cloud Services, resulting in a major impact on Customer’s operations. Work cannot reasonably continue.
* **Critical Incidents**: Customer’s problem has a significant business impact; however, operations can continue in a restricted fashion. The Cloud Services are usable but severely limited. There is no acceptable workaround available. Customer is experiencing a significant loss of service.
* **Standard Incidents**: Customer’s problem has some business impact. The Cloud Services are usable and cause only minor inconvenience. It may be a minor Error, documentation Error, or incorrect operation of the Cloud Services, which does not significantly impede the operation of the Cloud Service.

### Customer responsibilities

* Customer assigns Authorized Technical Contacts (ATCs) and communicates any changes to the list of ATCs to Provider.
* Customer's ATC is responsible for cooperating with Provider's Global Support and providing necessary information to reproduce, troubleshoot and resolve the experienced error.
* When an incident is submitted by an ATC to Provider's Support Portal, Customer authorizes Provider, for the purposes of troubleshooting and resolving such incident, to access Customer’s cloud environment for the duration of the submitted incident.
