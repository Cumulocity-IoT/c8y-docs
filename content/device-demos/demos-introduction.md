This guide contains simple demo device integration tutorials that you can set up for proof-of-concept purposes in your Cumulocity environment. 
The tutorials show how you can register third party devices with Cumulocity in just a few minutes, and then view simple dashboards showing the data that Cumulocity is receiving from the third party devices. 
Some of the demo devices allow you to send messages from Cumulocity to the third party devices, thereby showing that a Cumulocity administrator with appropriate permissions can perform administrative tasks on remote devices.
