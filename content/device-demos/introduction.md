This guide describes simple device demos that you can set up for proof-of-concept purposes in your Cumulocity environment. The demos show how you can register third party devices with Cumulocity in just a few minutes, and then view simple dashboards showing the data Cumulocity is receiving from the third party devices. Some of the demos allow you to send messages from Cumulocity to the third party devices, thereby showing that a Cumulocity administrator with appropeirta permissions can perform administrative tasks on remote devices.
