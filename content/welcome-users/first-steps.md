2. In the **Menu label** field, enter a name for the report and optionally provide a description below.
3. Select **Show in navigator** if you want the report to be displayed in the navigator. Select the position of the report in the navigator. Depending on the value it will be positioned relative to the existing items. If, for example, "Home" has the value "10000" it will be positioned above "Home", if the value is "10001" or higher.
4. In the **Layout** section you can select a theme for the report (for example, "Light", "Dark", "Transparent" or "Branded") and a default header style for the widgets (for example, "Regular", "Border", "Overlay", or "Hidden"). Moreover, you can change the default widget margin (the default value is set to 15 px).
If you enable the option **Translate widget titles if possible**, the widget title will be translated every time the language is changed. Note that the widget titles will be translated only if a valid translation is available.
Click **Save** to create the report and add it to the report list.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
In the **Preview** section at the right, a preview of the selected layout settings is immediately displayed to visualize your selections.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

You have successfully created a report.

Follow the instructions below to create a new report. It may be necessary to check if you meet the [requirements](/cockpit/working-with-reports/) first.

Go to the [Working with reports](/cockpit/working-with-reports/) for more on how to edit and delete reports.

### Step 6: Adding a widget to a dashboard or a report

Widgets can display maps, images, graphs, tables and other graphic representations of data. Widgets are useful to track information, for example on alarms, assets or applications, or provide maps, quick links and more in dashboards or reports.  Go to [Widgets collection](/cockpit/widgets-collection/) to see a list of all preset widgets that {{< product-c8y-iot >}} provides.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
You can also develop your own widgets and add them to your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} account. For more information go to [Add a custom widget to a dashboard](/web/tutorials/#add-a-custom-widget-to-dashboard).
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

#### To add a widget to a dashboard or a report

1. Click **Add widget** in the top menu bar or click the **Add widget** button on the main page (only available in case of an empty dashboard or report).
