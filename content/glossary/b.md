### Blocks {#blocks}

Used in the context of [Analytics Builder](/glossary/a/#analytics-builder).

Blocks are the basic processing units of the [model](/glossary/m/#model). Each block has some predefined functionality and processes data accordingly. A block can have a set of parameters and a set of input ports and output ports.

### Build artifact {#build-artifact}

In the release notes for yearly releases, each change entry includes information on the related build artifact. The term "build artifact" refers to the technical software component in the build pipeline, for example, "c8y-ui".
