Cumulocity offers a wide range of functionality for interfacing IoT devices and other IoT-related data sources with the Cumulocity IoT platform.

This Device SDK guide provides detailed information on device integration using [MQTT](/guides/device-sdk/mqtt), [REST](/guides/device-sdk/rest), [C++](/guides/device-sdk/cpp) and [C#](/guides/device-sdk/hello-mqtt-cs-0).

For information on the general concept of agents being used for interfacing IoT data sources with Cumulocity, refer to [Interfacing devices](/guides/concepts/interfacing-devices) in the Concepts guide.
