This section will list the implementation details for the MQTT protocol. The Cumulocity IoT implementation supports MQTT Version 3.1.1.

### Connecting via MQTT

Cumulocity IoT supports MQTT both via TCP and WebSockets. As URL you can use your tenant domain (e.g. _mytenant.cumulocity.com/mqtt_) or the domain of the instance in the format mqtt.&lt;instance_domain> (e.g. _mqtt.cumulocity.com_).

Available ports:

| &nbsp; | TCP | WebSockets |
|:-----|:----|:----|
| one-way SSL | 8883 | 443 |
| no SSL | 1883 | 80 |
| experimental two-way SSL | 1884 | - |

For experimental two-way SSL the port 1884 has to be enabled. To do that, add the following rule to Chef:

```
"MQTTClientCert" => {
    "enabled" => true,
    "enableTransparentSSLPort" => false
}
```

*   `enabled` - Open the port 1884 and let devices authorize using a certificate with TCP (it is not available with WebSockets right now).
*   `enableTransparentSSLPort` - Redirect the whole communication (ports) from 1883 to 1884 (use `false` since handling client authorization via username and password is not implemented yet), so right now it will enforce using certificates by devices also on 1883 port (which is highly not recommended).

> **Info**: To use WebSockets you need to connect to the path <kbd>/mqtt</kbd> and follow the [MQTT standard](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc398718127) for WebSocket communication.

### SmartREST payload

The Cumulocity IoT MQTT implementation uses SmartREST as a payload. SmartREST is a CSV-like message protocol that uses templates on the server side to create data in Cumulocity IoT.

> **Info:** For all MQTT connections to the platform, the maximum accepted payload size is 16184 bytes, which includes both message header and body. The header size varies, but its minimum is 2 bytes.

#### SmartREST basics

A SmartREST message is a single row in which each parameter is separated by comma. The first parameter is an ID that defines the message. You can send multiple messages in a single publish by using a line break between messages.

#### SmartREST escaping

The CSV (comma-separated values) format is used for communication with the SmartREST endpoint. The following rules must be followed to ensure a frictionless communication.

* Every row must be terminated by the `\n` character sequence.
* Values are always separated by a comma (`,`).
* If a value contains double-quotes (`"`), commas (`,`), leading or trailing whitespaces, line-breaks (`\n`), carriage returns (`\r`) or tab stops, it must be surrounded by quotes (`"`). Contained double-quotes (`"`) must be escaped by prepending another double-quote (`""`).

The same escaping rules apply to messages that will be sent from the server to the client.

Publish example:

```text
100,"This value, needs escaping",This value does not need escaping
```

Subscribe example:

```text
511,myDeviceSerial,"execute this\nand this\nand ""this"""
```

> **Info:** `\n` does not create a new line in the output (e.g. console, UI); to achieve this, a new line character (ASCII 0A) needs to be used.

### Device hierarchies

MQTT sessions are linked to a single device, but this device can have a freely configurable device hierarchy below it.

All children require a unique ID defined when creating the device. We recommend using a combination of the unique ID of the root device and a unique ID within the hierarchy.

To create data for a child instead of the root device, the unique ID of the child is added as another section in the topic (e.g. <kbd>s/us/myChildDeviceIdentifier</kbd>).

The client will automatically receive operations for every child in the hierarchy by subscribing to the respective topic. It is not required to subscribe for each child.

Every operation received will contain the template ID followed by the ID of the device/child for which the operation was created (followed by other operation parameters).

### MQTT features

#### MQTT authentication

The communication with Cumulocity IoT employing MQTT supports authentication in two ways:

*   Username and password. The MQTT username needs to include the tenant ID and username in the format &lt;tenantID/username>.
*   Device certificates. The devices have to contain the whole chain of certificates leading to the trusted root certificate. Also, they have to contain the server certificate in their truststore.

#### MQTT ClientId

The MQTT ClientId is a field to uniquely identify each connected client. The Cumulocity IoT implementation also uses the ClientId to link the client directly to a device. Therefore the following format should be used for the ClientId:

"connectionType:deviceIdentifier:defaultTemplateIdentifier"

|Field|Mandatory|Description|
|:-------|:--------|:--------|
|connectionType|NO|Indication of connection type <br>default: d (device)|
|deviceIdentifier|YES|A unique identifier for your device, e.g. IMEI, Serial number|
|defaultTemplateIdentifier|NO|Check the SmartREST section for more information about template identifiers|

For the simplest version of a client, the MQTT clientId can just be the deviceIdentfier. It will automatically be interpreted as device connection.

Example ClientIds:

```text
mySerialNumber
d:mySerialNumber
d:mySerialNumber:myDefaultTemplate
```

The uniqueness of the MQTT ClientId is determined only by the deviceIdentifier. Therefore from the above examples only one client can be connected at the same time.

During a SSL connection with certificates, the `deviceIdentifier` has to match the Common Name of the used certificate (first certificate in the chain, which is provided by the device).

#### MQTT Quality of Service

The Cumulocity IoT implementation supports all 3 levels of MQTT QoS:

* QoS 0: At most once
    - The client just sends the message once (fire and forget)
    - No reaction from the server
* QoS 1: At least once
    - The client repeats the message until it receives a server acknowledgement
* QoS 2: Exactly once
    - The client sends a message
    - The server acknowledges (holds the message)
    - The client sends a release command
    - The server processes the messages and acknowledges again

For subscriptions to the operation or error topics, we will deliver all messages in the QoS which the client defined when subscribing to the topic.

#### MQTT clean session

MQTT clients can set the clean session flag to "0" (false). This will ensure that in case the client disconnects, your subscription will still work and when you reconnect the client will receive the missed messages.

>**Info:** Cumulocity IoT requires clean session to be set to "1" (true). Currently we cannot guarantee that disabling clean session will work reliably, hence we recommend to always enable clean session.

#### MQTT retained flag

In the current Cumulocity IoT implementation, subscriptions to topics where devices publish data are not allowed. Publishing data with the retained flag on this topic is allowed but has no practical difference to sending it without the flag.
Messages published by Cumulocity IoT like operations and errors do not contain the retained flag.

#### MQTT last will

In MQTT, the "last will" is a message that is specified at connection time and that is executed when the client loses the connection. For example, using `400,c8y_ConnectionEvent,"Device connection was lost."` as last will message and <kbd>s/us</kbd> as last will topic, raises an event whenever the device loses the connection.

> **Info:** The execution of the "last will" updates the device availability.

### Debugging

To support developers during development, it is possible to subscribe to the topic <kbd>s/e</kbd>. On this topic the device can retrieve debug and error messages that occur during a publish from the device.

>**Info**: This topic is purely designed to support the development of clients. It is not recommended to always subscribe to this channel as the messages are verbose and can significantly increase the data usage. Also, you should not use this topic to trigger actions of the device based on what you receive on the topic. It is not a response channel.

### Reloading server's certificate

There is a possibility to change server's certificate, which is sent to the devices. To do that, customer should contact the DevOps team, which can add the new certificate to server's keystore and reload it.

Certificates exchange occurs during device connection, so all already connected devices will not be disconnected during reloading. Only after they disconnect on their own and try to connect later, then they will have to contain that new server's certificate in their truststore.
 
>**Info**: This functionality is designed to renewing or changing the server's certificate, when it is going to expire.
