### Electricity sensor

At the most basic level electricity sensors (electricity meters, watt-hour meters) measure energy consumption (usually measured in kWh), however they can measure much more depending on their complexity, such as "demand", or instantaneous power (usually measured in W), reactive power, harmonic distortion, and more. Meters can measure for a single phase (typical just for home usage) or for three phases.

### c8y\_SinglePhaseElectricitySensor

In a managed object, a single phase electricity meter is modeled as a simple empty fragment:

```json
"c8y_SinglePhaseElectricitySensor" : {}
```

### c8y\_SinglePhaseEnergyMeasurement

|Measurement|Units|Description|
|:----------|:----|:----------|
|A+|kWh|Total active energy, in|
|A-|kWh|Total active energy, out|
|P+|W|Total active power, in|
|P-|W|Total active power, out|

```json
"c8y_SinglePhaseEnergyMeasurement": {
  "A+": { "value": 123, "unit": "kWh" },

  "P+": { "value": 56, "unit": "W" },
  "P-": { "value": 0, "unit": "W" }
}
```

### c8y\_ThreePhaseElectricitySensor

In a managed object, a three phase electricity meter is modeled as a simple empty fragment:

```json
"c8y_ThreePhaseElectricitySensor" : {}
