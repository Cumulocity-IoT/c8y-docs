The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform distinguishes between applications and microservices, see also [Developing applications](/concepts/applications) in the *Concepts guide*.

* [Applications](#applications) -  all web applications either subscribed to the tenant or owned by the tenant.

* [Microservices](#managing-microservices) - server-side applications used to develop further functionality on top of {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

Both can be accessed via the **Ecosystem** menu in the navigator.

Additionally, in {{< enterprise-tenant >}}s, it is possible to configure **Default subscriptions**, that means you can specify a list of applications that are subscribed by default to every new tenant on creation and/or to all existing tenants on platform upgrade. For details, see [Enterprise tenant > Default subscriptions](/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/#default-subscriptions).
