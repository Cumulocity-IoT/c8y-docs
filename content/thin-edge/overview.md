### Why `thin-edge.io`

An open-source & cloud-agnostic IoT framework designed for resource-constrained Edge devices.

* Simple and secure device connectivity.
* Freedom of cloud platform.
* Freedom of programming language.

### How to start

1) The very first step is to [install `thin-edge.io`](/thin-edge/thin-edge-howto-guides/#installation)
and to connect your device to your IoT cloud,
either [{{< product-c8y-iot >}}](/thin-edge/thin-edge-tutorials/#connect-c8y)
or [Azure IoT](/thin-edge/thin-edge-tutorials/#connect-azure) (10 minutes).
2) You will then be able to [send telemetry data](/thin-edge/thin-edge-tutorials/#send-thin-edge-data) to the cloud
using a [cloud-agnostic message format](/thin-edge/thin-edge-architecture/#thin-edge-json) (5 minutes).
3) The next step is to write your own telemetry component, using your preferred programming language,
say Rust or Python.

### Grow your skills

* Explore the [tutorials and use-cases](/thin-edge/thin-edge-tutorials).
* Understand the [architecture](/thin-edge/thin-edge-architecture).
* Use the [how-to guides](/thin-edge/thin-edge-howto-guides) on a daily basis.
* Refer to the [reference guides](/thin-edge/thin-edge-developer-tools) for any in-depth details.
