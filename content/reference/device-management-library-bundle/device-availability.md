#### c8y\_RequiredAvailability

Devices can be monitored for availability by adding a "c8y\_RequiredAvailability" fragment to the device:

    "c8y_RequiredAvailability": { "responseInterval": <<time in minutes>> }

Devices that have not sent any message in the response interval plus a 180 seconds delay are considered unavailable. The response interval can have a value between -32768 and 32767 and any values out of range will be shrink to the range borders. Such devices are marked as unavailable (see below) and an unavailability alarm is raised.

Devices with `responseInterval` <= 0 are considered to be under maintenance. No alarm is raised while a device is under maintenance.

Devices that do not contain "c8y\_RequiredAvailability" are not monitored.

#### c8y\_Availability and c8y\_Connection

The availability information computed by Cumulocity IoT is stored in the fragments "c8y\_Availability" and "c8y\_Connection" of the device.

    "c8y_Availability": { "lastMessage": "2013-05-21...", "status": "AVAILABLE" },
    "c8y_Connection": {"status":"CONNECTED"}

|Name|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:----------|
|lastMessage|Date|The time when the device sent the last message to Cumulocity IoT.|
|status|String|The current status, one of AVAILABLE, UNAVAILABLE, MAINTENANCE.|

The following messages update the last message timestamp of a device:

-   Create an event, measurement or alarm (for given device as source)
-   Update the device itself (with given id) sending empty PUT request or request with id only, ie. {} or {"id":...}

A monitored device has one of the following statuses for c8y_Connection:

|Name|Description|
|:---|:----------|
|CONNECTED|A device push connection is established.|
|DISCONNECTED|"responseInterval" is larger than 0 and the device is neither AVAILABLE nor CONNECTED.|
|MAINTENANCE|"responseInterval" is set to 0; the device is under maintenance.|

>**Info:** If a device is not connected via device push, but a message was sent within the required response interval, c8y_Availability can still have the status AVAILABLE, even if c8y_Connection does not have the status CONNECTED.

#### c8y\_UnavailabilityAlarm

The alarm sent when a device becomes unavailable is of type "c8y\_UnavailabilityAlarm":

    {
        ...
        "type" : "c8y_UnavailabilityAlarm",
        "text" : "No communication with device since <<last activity time>>",
        "status" : "active",
        "severity" : "major",
        "source" : <<device id>>
        ...
    }

Updates to the availability status may occur with a delay.

To flag a device as available without updating any data, a "ping" can be sent. The "ping" can be carried out by simply sending an empty update message to the device (i.e., a PUT request to the managed object with empty content).

#### c8y\_ActiveAlarmsStatus

The number of currently active and acknowledged alarms is stored in a fragment "c8y\_ActiveAlarmsStatus".

    "c8y_ActiveAlarmsStatus": {
        "minor": 1,
        "major": 3
    }
