Inventory notifications permit the monitoring of changes in the inventory (CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE).

The basic protocol for receiving notifications is described in [Real-time notifications](/guides/reference/real-time-notifications). 

The URL is:

```http
    /cep/realtime
```

The subscription channel must contain the managed object ID of the object in the inventory to be monitored or a "*" as placeholder to receive notifications for the entire inventory.

```http
    /managedobjects/<<managedObjectId>>
```

In addition to the managed object, the response will  contain a `realtimeAction` to identify which action resulted in the given object (CREATE, UPDATE or DELETE). In case of a deletion the data will only contain the ID of the deleted managed object.

Required role: ROLE\_INVENTORY\_READ
