### OperationCollection [application/vnd.com.nsn.cumulocity.operationCollection+json]

|Name|Type|Occurs|Description|
|:---|:---|:-----|:----------|
|self|string|1|A URL linking to this resource.|
|operations|Operations|0..n|List of operations, see below.|
|statistics|PagingStatistics|1|Information about paging statistics.|
|prev|string|0..1|A URI linking to a potential previous page of operations.|
|next|string|0..1|A URI linking to a potential next page of operations.|

Notes about Operation Collections:

-   The embedded operation object contains "deviceExternalIDs" only when queried with an "agentId" parameter. 
-   The embedded operation object is filled with "deviceName", but only when requesting resource: Get a collection of operations.
-   Operations are returned in the order in which they have been created (a first-in-first-out queue).
