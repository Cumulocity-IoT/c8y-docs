There are two options to receive real-time notifications for the device control API.
The basic protocol for receiving notifications is described in the Section "[Real-time notifications](/guides/reference/real-time-notifications)".

### Receive operations for an agent

Real-time notifications permit an agent to almost immediately receive new operations targeted to it. For control-related notifications, use the URL

	/devicecontrol/notifications

The subscription channel needs to contain the managed object ID of the agent that wants to receive its operations:

	/<<agentId>>

For example, to subscribe on notifications about new operations created for the agent with the ID "5", the subscription channel should be the following string:

    /5

Required role: ROLE\_DEVICE\_CONTROL\_READ

### Receive operations for a device

This endpoint will not only result in returning newly created operations but also all updates (including deletion) of the operations for a device. The URL is

    /cep/realtime

The subscription channel needs to contain the managed object ID of the device or a "*" as placeholder to receive notifications for all devices

    /operations/<<deviceId>>

The response will additionally to the operation object contain a "realtimeAction" to identify which action resulted in the given object (CREATE, UPDATE or DELETE). In case of a deletion the data will only contain the id of the deleted operation.
