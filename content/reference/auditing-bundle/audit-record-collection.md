In case of executing range queries on audit logs API, like query by dateFrom and dateTo, audits are returned by default in order from the newest to the oldest.

It is possible to change the order by adding query parameter "revert=false" to the request URL. An example request would be: "<<url>>/audit/auditRecords?dateFrom=2019-09-01&dateTo=2019-09-06T08:26:42%2B02:00&revert=false".
