#### Search parameters for User Collection      

Users can be filtered by following parameters:

- username - prefix or full username
- groups - numeric group identifiers separated by commas; result will contain only users which belong to at least one of specified groups
- owner - exact username
- onlyDevices - boolean flag. If set to "true", result will contain only users created during bootstrap process (starting with "device\_").
 If flag is absent (or false) the result will not contain "device\_" users.

Additional flag "withSubusersCount" - if set to "true", then each of returned users will contain additional field "subusersCount" -
number of direct sub-users (users with corresponding "owner").

Example request: retrieve users, where username starts with "js", and every user belongs to one of the groups 2, 3 or 4, and the owner is "admin", and is not a device user.

    GET /user/<<tenant>>/users?username=js&groups=2,3,4&owner=admin&withSubusersCount=true
    Host: [hostname]
    Authorization: Basic xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    Accept: application/vnd.com.nsn.cumulocity.usercollection+json;ver=0.9
