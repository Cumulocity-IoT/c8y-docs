Device statistics are collected for each inventory object with at least one measurement, event or alarm. There are no additional checks if the inventory object is marked as device using *c8y_IsDevice* fragment. Simply when the first measurement, event or alarm is created for a specific inventory object Cumulocity IoT is always considering this as a device and starts counting.

Device statistics are counted with daily and monthy rate. 

Only requests with *Persistent* and *Quiescent* processing modes are considered when counting device statistics.

The following requests are counted:

* alarm creation and update
* event creation and update
* measurement creation
* bulk measurement creation is counted as multiple requests
* bulk alarm status update is counted as multiple requests
* MQTT and SmartREST requests with multiple rows are counted as multiple requests

Frequently asked questions:

* Are operations on device firmware counted?
**No**, device configuration and firmware update operates on inventory objects, thus they are not counted.
* Are requests done by the UI applications, for example when browsing device details, counted?
**No**, viewing device details performs only GET requests which are not counted.
* Is the clear alarm operation done from the UI counted?
**Yes**, a clear alarm operation in fact performs an alarm update operation and it will be counted as device request.
* Is there any operation performed on the device which is counted?
**Yes**, retrieving device logs requires from the device to create an event and attach a binary with logs to it. Those are two separate requests and both are counted.
* When I have a device with children are the requests counted always to the root device or separately for each child?
Separately for each child.
