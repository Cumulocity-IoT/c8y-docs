The alarm notification API permits the monitoring of alarms of specific devices.
The basic protocol for receiving notifications is described in the Section "[Real-time notifications](/reference/real-time-notifications)". The URL is

    /cep/realtime

The subscription channel needs to contain the managed object ID of the device or a "*" as placeholder to receive notifications for the alarms of all devices

    /alarms/<<deviceId>>

The response will additionally to the alarm object contain a "realtimeAction" to identify which action resulted in the given object (CREATE, UPDATE or DELETE). In case of a deletion the data will only contain the id of the deleted alarm.

Example Response:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
    Content-Type: application/json
