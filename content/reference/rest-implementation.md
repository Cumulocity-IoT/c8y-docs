With the Cumulocity IoT 10.9.0 release, we started using Open API to maintain our API documentation. Visit [our new API documentation](http://cumulocity.com/api) and have a look.

This section describes the aspects common to all REST-based interfaces of Cumulocity IoT. The interfaces are based on the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol 1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) using [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure).
