|Accept|application/vnd.com.nsn.cumulocity.event+json

```http
POST <<url>>/event/events

{
  "time" : "2011-09-06T12:03:27.845+02:00",
  "type" : "com_cumulocity_model_DoorSensorEvent",

	"id" : "12345",
	 ...
  }
}
```

#### Example response

|HEADERS||
|:---|:---|
|Content-Type|application/vnd.com.nsn.cumulocity.event+json;ver=...

```http
HTTP/1.1
201 - Created

{
  "id" : "10",
  "self" : "<<URL of new event>>",
  "time" : "2011-09-06T12:03:27.845+02:00",
  "creationTime" : "2011-09-06T12:03:27.927+02:00",
  "type" : "com_cumulocity_model_DoorSensorEvent",
  "text" : "Door sensor was triggered.",
  "source" : {
	"id":"12345",
	"self": "...",
	"name": "..."
  }
}
```

For POST requests, the source parameter is required to have only an `id`.

The `id` and `creationTime` of the new event are generated by the server and returned in the response to the POST operation.

In case of executing range queries on events API, like query by dateFrom and dateTo, the latest events are returned first. It is possible to change the order by adding query parameter "revert=true" to the request URL. In many use cases it is needed to get the oldest event sent from the device. This can be accomplished by passing "revert" param together with "dateFrom" and "dateTo" params to sort the outcome by date, e.g. pass dateFrom from a year ago, and dateTo from the feature.
