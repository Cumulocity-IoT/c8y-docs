Device credentials can be enquired by devices that do not have credentials for accessing a tenant yet. Since the device does not have credentials yet, a set of fixed credentials is used for this API. The credentials can be obtained by contacting [support](https://support.cumulocity.com). Do not use your tenant credentials with this API.
