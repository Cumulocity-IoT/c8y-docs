Device credentials can be enquired by devices that do not have credentials for accessing a tenant yet. Since the device does not have credentials yet, a set of fixed credentials is used for this API. The credentials can be obtained by
[contacting support](/about-doc/contacting-support). Do not use your tenant credentials with this API.
