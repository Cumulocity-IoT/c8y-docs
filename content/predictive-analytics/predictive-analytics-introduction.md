The predictive analytics capabilities in the Cumulocity IoT platform enable you to deploy and manage machine-learning models and custom resources, and use them for generating predictions on data gathered from your devices.

These capabilities can be leveraged either from a web browser via an easy to use UI (Predictive Analytics application) or programmatically via REST API (Zementis Microservice). 

This guide provides detailed information on the functionalities of the [Predictive Analytics application](/predictive-analytics/web-app) and a comprehensive listing of [REST API](/predictive-analytics/api-reference) exposed by Zementis Microservice.
