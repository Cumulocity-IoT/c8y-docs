This section deals with the basic data science steps of creating an activity recognition model with self-collected data. First of all, you need to register your iPhone. Then follow the sections below for collecting data, training the model and using the model to recognize activities via the phone. Note, that the phone for the entire workflow has to be of the same type because the data and sensors for device types may differ.

#### Register an iPhone in Cumulocity

Registering an iPhone on Cumulocity involves installing the Cloud Sensor App on your phone and using it for completing the registration. 

Follow the steps described in [Optional services > Cloud Sensor App](/users-guide/optional-services#android-cloud-sensor-app) in the User guide.

After the download, do the following on your iPhone: Open Settings > Click General > Click Device Management or Profiles & Device Management > Select Software AG > Trust "Software AGâ€œ.

Once registered, try to get the device ID by looking up your device on the **All Devices** page of your tenant's Device Management application. Now, update the `c_device_source` of the *CONFIG.INI* file with the device ID of your registered iPhone.

#### Data collection with Cumulocity

Collecting training data for activity recognition is done by starting the Cumulocity Cloud Sensor App, performing each one of the activities over a few minutes and noting the exact time period. As a next step, the instructions and scripts provided below can be used to collect training data per activity type. The resulting CSV files can be combined for the different activity classes, so that the final training data includes instances for all activity types.

Note that for demo purposes, the data is fetched via REST and directly transformed into the training data set. More complex pre-processing might require the use of an offline data store. The format of the JSON data might have changed in the meantime, or some sensors might not be available for some phone types, so check the exact format by viewing a current sample.

The following code block contains the data format of the JSON schema that was assumed for this demo.

	measurement.json
	{
	    "_id" : ObjectId("5c928ba9b524aca326d727fe"),
	    "self" : "https://zdev.cumulocity.com/measurement/measurements/7668082",
	    "time" : "2019-03-18T14:46:15.000-07:00",
	    "id" : "7668082",
	    "source" : {
	        "self" : "https://zdev.cumulocity.com/inventory/managedObjects/7668076",
	        "id" : "7668076"
	    },
	    "type" : "c8y_Acceleration",
	    "c8y_Acceleration" : {
	        "accelerationY" : {
	            "unit" : "G",
	            "value" : -0.2860107421875
	        },
	        "accelerationX" : {
	            "unit" : "G",
	            "value" : -0.1037750244140625
	        },
	        "accelerationZ" : {
	            "unit" : "G",
	            "value" : -0.9522247314453125
	        }
	    },
	    "activity" : "none"
	}

Data collection can be done by using the below shown and attached script *createData.py*. This Python script connects to the Cumulocity REST measurements endpoint, pulls the data, and writes it to a CSV file. 

For each activity type, the name of the activity and the timestamps need to be updated in the constants ACTIVITY, DATE_FROM and DATE_TO. Note that the format of the data might look slightly different. After the data sets for all activities are created, they can be combined for model training.

	createData.py
	import configparser
	import csv, os
	import requests
	import queue
	import numpy as np
	
	
	def add2Data(d, writer, activity):
	
		acc = d['c8y_Acceleration']	
		accelerationX = acc['accelerationX']
		accX_Val=accelerationX['value']
		accelerationY = acc['accelerationY']
		accY_Val=accelerationY['value']
		accelerationZ = acc['accelerationZ']
		accZ_Val=accelerationZ['value']
	
		
		# cutting off the first instances of the training data as the std dev is not accurate for those			
		writer.writerow([accX_Val, accY_Val, accZ_Val, activity])
	
	
	# collect config from CONFIG-INI -> change user and pass
	config = configparser.ConfigParser()
	config.read('CONFIG.INI')
	
	# use the dates in which a particular acitvity was perfomed
	DATE_FROM="2019-05-16T13:15:36.000-07:00"
	DATE_TO="2019-05-16T13:15:59.000-07:00"
	
	# specify the recorded activity
	ACTIVITY="jump"
	
	c_measurements_endpoint="/measurement/measurements/"
	
	# maximum page size is 2000; only taking acceleration measurements
	c_params={"source":config.get("cumulocity", "c_device_source"),"pageSize":"2000", "dateFrom":DATE_FROM, "dateTo":DATE_TO, "valueFragmentType":"c8y_Acceleration"}
	
	
	# get first page of json data measurements from cumulocity
	c_auth=config.get("cumulocity", "c_user"),config.get("cumulocity", "c_pass")
	r=requests.get(config.get("cumulocity","c_url")+c_measurements_endpoint,params=c_params, auth=c_auth) 
	print("Start collecting data from: "+r.url)
	print("Status code: "+str(r.status_code))
	
	# training data file
	DIR_DATA="data/"
	DATA_FILE=DIR_DATA+"generated_dataset_"+ACTIVITY+".csv"
	
	 # collect data
	json_doc=r.json()
	data=[]
	
	if not os.path.exists(DIR_DATA):
	    os.makedirs(DIR_DATA)
	    
	with open(DATA_FILE, mode='w') as training_file:
		writer = csv.writer(training_file, delimiter=',', quotechar='"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
		writer.writerow(["accelerationX","accelerationY","accelerationZ", "activity"])
		
		first_arr=json_doc['measurements']	
		
		print("Page 1.\tCollecting data at: " +first_arr[0]['time'])
		
		for d in first_arr:	
			add2Data(d, writer, ACTIVITY)
			 
	
		# change the range depending on amount of training data required
		for i in range(5):
			r=requests.get(json_doc['next'], auth=c_auth) 
			next_doc=r.json()
			measure_arr=next_doc['measurements']
		
			if not measure_arr:
				print("Last page reached.")
				break
		
			print("Page "+ str(i+2)+".\tCollecting data at: "+ measure_arr[0]['time'])
	
			for d in measure_arr:	
				add2Data(d, writer, ACTIVITY)
				
			json_doc=next_doc
	
	print("Data written to " + DATA_FILE)
	

The training data set we collected is attached as *data/training_demo_data_jump.csv* in the attached *ActivityRecognitionDemo.zip*. The data created in the above script will need to be transformed into that same format once data for all activity types is obtained.


#### Train the PMML model

The attached Python script *createModel.py* creates a Decision Tree Model in PMML format using the previously created training data. The reason we chose this model type was that it can be easily interpreted and it performed well in our evaluations. 

New fields are created by calculating the standard deviation of a sample of 5 previous records. If no training data was created with the *createData.py* script, sample training data for the activities sit, run and jump can be found under **data/training_demo_data_jump.csv** of the attached ZIP file. It is then used for training the model with the help of the scikit-learn framework ([https://scikit-learn.org](https://scikit-learn.org)). To obtain a robust and meaningful model, further cleaning of the training data and validating the best model parameters is required. This is not in the scope of this demo and presumes knowledge of data science. After the model is created in scikit-learn, it is converted into PMML format with the Nyoka library ([https://github.com/nyoka-pmml/nyoka](https://github.com/nyoka-pmml/nyoka)). 

The script also contains a 10-fold cross validation and the evaluation against some test data. This data was obtained by having an additional person perform the three activities. The resulting numbers can give an outlook of how good the model can perform when showcasing the demo. The files that we used for testing are contained in the ZIP folder under *data/test_demo_data_jump.csv*. When you use your own test data, follow the same format. The script will also create a graph-based representation of the decision tree as *graph_decision_tree.pdf*.

#### Upload the model to Cumulocity

In order to upload the model to Cumulocity, follow the steps described in [Predictive Analytics application > Managing models](/predictive-analytics/web-app/#managing-models).

A pre-trained model *ActivitiesDTreeJump.pmml* is also attached for reference. This activity recognition model was trained with the data available in *data/training_demo_data_jump.csv* mentioned in the previous section.

#### Create and upload Apama monitor to Cumulocity

For this active recognition scenario, we need to use Apama streaming analytics. With Apama streaming analytics, you can add your own logic to your IoT solution for immediate processing of incoming data from devices or other data sources. This user-defined logic can, e.g. alert applications of new incoming data, create new operations based on the received data (such as sending an alarm when a threshold for a sensor is exceeded), or trigger operations on devices.

We create an EPL-based monitor file and upload it to Cumulocity. As mentioned earlier, the Apama EPL monitor file takes care of reading the measurements coming from the mobile device, sending it to the Zementis microservice and raising an alarm when any change in activity is reported by our machine learning model.

Instead of creating a new monitor file, the attached *RecognizeActivities.mon* file can be used after making minor adjustments. Open *RecognizeActivities.mon* in a text editor and replace the `deviceId` variable with the ID of your registered device, same as `c_device_source` in the *CONFIG.INI* file mentioned above. Save your changes and upload this monitor file to your tenant. See [Deploying Apama applications as single \*.mon files with Apama EPL Apps] (/apama/analytics-introduction/#single-mon-file) in the Streaming analytics guide for details on uploading Apama monitor files.
