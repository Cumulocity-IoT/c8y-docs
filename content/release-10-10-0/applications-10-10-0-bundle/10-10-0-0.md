<tr>
<td>
Web SDK </td>
<td > To provide greater developer flexibility the components from the `@c8y/ngx-components/operations` package have been split into finer-grained modules. This enables the components to be used individually and gives more flexibility for re-using components from the <b>Bulk operations</b> page in custom applications;  e.g. using a subset of the standard provided bulk operation types and defining custom ones. </td>
<td>
MTM-36243</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > When a new application is created using the Web SDK CLI (c8ycli), the branding options are now set by default. This way the tenant branding configuration will now always be applied to all custom applications created with the Web SDK CLI. </td>

<td>
SmartRules</td>
<td > When creating a smart rule for an operation in the &lt;b&gt;Control&lt;/b&gt; tab of a device, hovering over the remove button caused the cursor to flicker. This has been fixed, and the cursor no longer flickers.</td>
