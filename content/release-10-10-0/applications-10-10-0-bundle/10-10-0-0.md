<td > The visualization of the "Silo" and "Linear gauge" widgets as well as of the data points in the Data Point Library has been improved. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Java SDK</td>
<td > The Java SDK has been updated to use the Jersey 2.33 library. As a result, if you update your Java SDK library you will have to change some of the classes used. For further information, see the Migration guide which is available at https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/documentation/latest/migration.html#mig-1.x </td>

<td > As part of the continuous process of ensuring all components of Cumulocity IoT use the latest libraries, the Jakarta HTTP client has been replaced by Apache HttpComponents 4.x.</td>

<tr>

Web SDK</td>
<td > Developer experience has been improved with hover-over documentation provided whilst coding in the IDE of choice. </td>

<td > Support for Internet Explorer has been removed. </td>
<td>
MTM-37355</td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK </td>
<td > To provide greater developer flexibility the components from the `@c8y/ngx-components/operations` package have been split into finer-grained modules. This enables the components to be used individually and gives more flexibility for re-using components from the <b>Bulk operations</b> page in custom applications;  e.g. using a subset of the standard provided bulk operation types and defining custom ones. </td>
<td>
MTM-36243</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > When a new application is created using the Web SDK CLI (c8ycli), the branding options are now set by default. This way the tenant branding configuration will now always be applied to all custom applications created with the Web SDK CLI. </td>
<td>
MTM-37259</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > The `preventDuplicates` flag added to the `NavigatorNodeData` interface allows multiple modules to independently declare the same navigator node. Setting the flag to `true` will prevent the node to appear more than once in the navigator if one or more other modules have also declared it. Two nodes are considered a duplicate if they have the same `path`, `label` and `parent`. </td>
<td>
MTM-37981</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > The Web SDK has been enhanced to allow the `ProviderConfigurationModule` to support tabs as part of its navigation. The JSON object will optionally contain a tab definition; this tab will then be displayed in the view for that navigation path. </td>
<td>
MTM-37982</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK </td>
<td > The ngx-components documentation has been improved. The complete ApplicationOptions interface specification is now available under http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/ngx-components/classes/ApplicationOptions.html. </td>
<td>
MTM-38090</td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > The <code>DynamicFormsUIThemeModule</code> (@c8y/ngx-components) provides a UI library with form controls to build dynamic forms with the <code>DynamicFormsModule</code> (@c8y/ngx-components) based on Angular Formly. The library has been extended with a file picker/drop area control allowing developers to declare file inputs in their dynamic forms. The type can be declared in both Formly schema (<code>type: 'file'</code>) and JSON schema. In the case of JSON schema every property having <code>contentEncoding</code> and/or <code>contentMediaType</code> properties defined will be mapped to <code>type: 'file'</code>. </td>

<tr>
<td>
SmartRules</td>
<td > When creating a smart rule for an operation in the &lt;b&gt;Control&lt;/b&gt; tab of a device, hovering over the remove button caused the cursor to flicker. This has been fixed, and the cursor no longer flickers.</td>
