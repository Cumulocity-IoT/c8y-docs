LWM2M</td>
<td> The resourceValue fragment added to events and alarms now works with opaque resources. Measurements cannot be created with opaque resource values. If enabled, it will create a warning alarm if non-numeric/non-boolean values are received.
Additionally, the type for no-mapping-known alarms has been improved by including the object ID.
