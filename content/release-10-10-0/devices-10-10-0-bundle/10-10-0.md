<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td > After a LWM2M device is registered against Cumulocity IoT, post registration operations (if specified) will be send to the device. With this enhancement, only post registration operations which carry a path to an existing LWM2M object on the respective device and operations without a path will be send. This enhancement optimizes the communication between the platform and the device. </td>

Device Management</td>
<td > To improve performance, the sorting of groups and devices has been changed. The sorting will now be case-sensitive, like for example "AAA BBB CCC aaa bbb..." instead of "aaa AAA bbb CCC ccc...".</td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Monitoring</td>
<td > To ensure a correct availability status of devices also in edge conditions, the consistency of the cache used for device availability monitoring has been improved.</td>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td > When an operation is cancelled in the UI, the LWM2M agent would not consider this cancellation and still update the operation status.
The agent was modified to check if an operation has been cancelled before updating the status of that operation.</td>
