<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td > After removing delegated users, audit logs were not displayed for the shared user manager role and an error message "Cannot find document with ID" was displayed. The issue has been fixed by making sure that such events do no longer prevent audit logs from being displayed. </td>

<tr>
<td>

<tr>
<td>
Two-factor authentication</td>
<td > The <b>Limit Token Validity</b> field has been disabled for OAuth Internal. A popup message has been added which informs the user that in case of OAuth Internal the JWT token validity is used so that the field cannot be edited. </td>
