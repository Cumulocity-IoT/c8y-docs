When you open the gateway you will find the **Remote access** tab in its tab list.

In the **Remote Access** tab, you can configure devices for remote control, so-called "endpoints", and connect to remote devices.

Connections can be established to the gateway itself (localhost) or to any device in the local area network reachable by the device.
