For each gateway device, audit logs are available.

The audit logs can be found in the **Control** tab of the gateway device.

For each connection, the Cloud Remote Access microservice creates an operation in scope of the current user. Then the operation will be updated by the device to reflect the current status. Finally, the operation will have a status of SUCCESSFUL or FAILED.
