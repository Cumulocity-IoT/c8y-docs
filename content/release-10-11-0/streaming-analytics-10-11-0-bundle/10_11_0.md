### Improvements for EPL apps

It is now possible to download EPL apps as \*.mon files. For this purpose, the actions menu which is available on the card of an EPL app 
now provides an **Export** command. See also [Developing apps with the Streaming Analytics application](https://cumulocity.com/guides/apama/analytics-introduction/#apama-epl-apps).

### Changes in the Apama-ctrl manifest

The Apama-ctrl microservice manifest now includes the following additional permissions:

- ROLE_AUDIT_ADMIN
- ROLE_AUDIT_READ
- ROLE_USER_MANAGEMENT_READ
- ROLE_USER_MANAGEMENT_OWN_READ
- ROLE_TENANT_MANAGEMENT_READ
- ROLE_BULK_OPERATION_ADMIN
- ROLE_BULK_OPERATION_READ
- ROLE_MACHINE_LEARNING_READ

This means that all requests from EPL apps or other components within the Apama-ctrl microservice operate with these additional permissions 
and thus can do the following:

- Create and read audit reports.
- Get information about the current user or tenant.
- Query information about tenants and applications.
- Create, read and modify bulk operations.
- Continue to apply and score Machine Learning models after the authorization requirements have been tighened up in the Zementis microservice.
