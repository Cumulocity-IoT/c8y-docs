### Core platform

#### Upgrade to Angular 12

With GA release 10.12.0.0 we plan to upgrade Angular from version 11 to version 12. As the view engine is deprecated we will also change the default renderer to Ivy.

This change will only affect you, if you or your development team use the Web SDK to extend Cumulocity IoT UI applications or to build your own web applications.

For instructions on the upgrade process refer to [Upgrade > Updating the Web SDK](https://cumulocity.com/guides/web/upgrade/#update-to-an-newer-version) in the *Web SDK guide*.

Additionally, you can use the following resources for more details on the changes in Ivy and Angular 12:
