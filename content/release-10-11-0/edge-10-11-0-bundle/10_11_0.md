### Known issues

|<div style="width:100px">Ticket</div>|<div style="width:200px">Area</div>|Description
|:---|:---|:---
|CIE-2331|Administration|**Issue:** If you are upgrading from Edge version 10.9 where you have changed the remote tenant URL, you must change the tenant URL to something else and back to have the remote connectivity feature working, after the upgrade.
|CIE-2577|REST API|**Issue:** Sometimes, a request to an endpoint returns an HTTP status code 408: Request Timeout response. For example, a request to the endpoint /edge/tasks/{id} can return a 408 response.<br><br>**Workaround:** Ignore the 408 response and retry the request.
|CIE-2592|Microservices|**Issue:** The Upload Microservice option appears even after disabling the microservice hosting feature.
