### Improvements in Machine Learning Engine

* Enhancements:
    * The Machine Learning Engine now comes with Role Based Access Control which mandates assigning users to the Machine Learning Global Roles or User groups in order to enable them to use Cumulocity IoT Machine Learning.
    * Added extra validations in Scheduled Processing while a job is being scheduled.
    * Restrictions imposed in the Machine Learning application upon usage of large texts in the input fields. Max length is restricted to 200 characters. Also, restrictions have been imposed upon usage of certain special characters.
    * Machine Learning application now shows all the error messages in the form of alerts to deliver a consistent user experience.
    * Retention period for events created during training of Clustering models is made longer. This will result in getting the.
    * Improvements were made in overall log patterns and log statements of the Machine Learning Engine microservices.

* Upgrades:
    * Python version in Nyoka and Onnx microservices upgraded from 3.6 to 3.7.11.
    * The version of onnx-runtime used in Onnx microservice has been upgraded from 1.3.0 to 1.5.2.
    * Zementis microservice has been updated to use UBI8 as it base OS instead of Alpine.
    * Angular version used in Machine Learning application upgraded from angular 8 to angular 11.

* Bug fixes:
    * Earlier in certain scenarios, Zementis microservice failed to start if it encountered issues while restoring existing artifacts. This is now handled gracefully.
    * The HTTP response code with which `{{url}}/service/zementis/train/timeseries` and `{{url}}/service/zementis/train/clustering` APIs respond has been updated from `200 - OK` to `202 - Accepted`.
    * JSON parser now throws a consistent `400 - Bad Request` when an incorrect JSON is passed by the user. Earlier it was throwing `500 - Internal Server Error` in some cases.
    * Scoring of invalid file was throwing plain text error causing Machine learning application to break. This is fixed now.
