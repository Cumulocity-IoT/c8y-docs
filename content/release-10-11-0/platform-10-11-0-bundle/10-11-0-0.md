See <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/cockpit/#smart-rules" class="no-ajaxy"<Cockpit > Smart rules</a> in the *Protocol integration guide*.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td > Breadcrumbs are no longer duplicated on the <b>Simulator</b> page and the <b>SmartRest templates</b> page. The issue occurred since this feature had not been fully migrated to the ngx-component. Now, breadcrumbs in AngularJS can be added in 3 different places/ways:
<br>- c8yBreadcrumbsSet component
<br>- c8yBreadcrumbsProvider by adding breadcrumbs array
<br>- c8yBreadcrumbsProvider by adding function which can be invoked
<br>All breadcrumbs added by AngularJS in one of these ways should now work correctly.</td>
