All AI/ML use cases start with (next to defining the objective of the use case) defining the data requirements and compiling a set of historical IoT data for training purposes. The IoT data, which is ingested from the connected devices, machines and equipment is retained in the Operational Store of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} for a limited amount of time. To support long-term (and cost-efficient) storage, as well as easy data extraction, offloading and/or querying for the purpose of developing ML models, the DataHub add-on product is suggested.

See the [DataHub documentation](/datahub/) for more information.
