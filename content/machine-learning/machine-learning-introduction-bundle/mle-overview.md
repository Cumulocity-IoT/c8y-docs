Machine Learning Engine enables machine learning/IT Ops to manage and operationalize a production-ready models for generating predictions on data gathered from connected devices. These capabilities can be leveraged either from a web browser via an easy to use graphical user interface or programmatically via REST API. Machine Learning Engine provides a high-performance inference platform with deployed models exposed as endpoints that can be leveraged from [Streaming Analytics](/apama/microservices/) and other applications for real-time inference.

Machine Learning Engine is composed of following components:

| Name  | Application Type | Description |
