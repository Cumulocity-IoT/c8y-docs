Cumulocity IoT Machine Learning simplifies the complexity of data science process across the entire machine learning lifecycle from model training to deployment. Cumulocity IoT Machine Learning is composed of two applications: Machine Learning Workbench, which focuses on model training and Machine Learning Engine, which focuses on model deployment.

The handover of the models from training environment to deployment environment is done via open-standards representation: [PMML](http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-4-1/GeneralStructure.html) and [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/). Open-standards based representation of machine learning models ensures interoperability between heterogeneous model development and deployment environments.
