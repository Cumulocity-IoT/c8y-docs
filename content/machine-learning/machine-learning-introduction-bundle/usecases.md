To get a better understanding of how to leverage Machine Learning capabilities on Cumulocity IoT, we have provided detailed examples as part of this documentation. Each example covers an usecase and walks you through the entire machine learning lifecyle from data ingestion, model training/evaluation to model deployment and inferencing.

| Use Case  | Description |
| -----     | -----       |
| [Demand Forecasting](/machine-learning/demand-forecasting/) | Forecast the peak/non-peak hours of water consumption using a Time Series model |
| [Activity Recognition](/machine-learning/activity-recognition/) | Predict human activities - sitting, running or jumping - based on sensor data from a mobile device |
| [Anomaly Detection](/machine-learning/anomaly-detection/) | Detect anomalous events through the sensor data of a mobile device |
| [Casting Defect Detection](/machine-learning/casting-defect-detection/) | Identify defects in metal casting process by leveraging deep learning algorithms |
