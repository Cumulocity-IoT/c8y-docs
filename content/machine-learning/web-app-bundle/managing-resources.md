### Uploading resources

To upload a new resource, first click on the tab (PMML or ONNX) depending on whether the resource is for a PMML model or an ONNX pipeline, then click **Add resource**, navigate to the desired resource file and then click **Open**. 

Once your resource is successfully uploaded, you will see a corresponding confirmation message. The new resource will be added to the resources list. 


### Downloading resources

To download the source file of a resource, click the download icon in its card.

Typically the source will either be a jar file or an Excel sheet for PMML resource and python file for ONNX resource.

### Deleting resources

To delete a resource, click the delete icon on its card and confirm the deletion.  

Once a resource is deleted, it will be removed permanently from your resources list.
