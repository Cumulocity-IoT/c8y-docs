The Machine Learning web app enables you to manage your models by providing options for uploading, downloading, or activating/deactivating your models. The web app supports models represented in PMML and ONNX formats. It also provides you insights into your models by capturing runtime performance and showcasing it via meaningful KPIs.

The Machine Learning web app also allows you to create model groups, manage custom resources which your models might need, create inference pipelines by combining custom pre-processing and post-processing code with relevant models, and schedule batch jobs for processing measurements from devices or device groups against an available model or model group.

The following sections will walk you through all functionalities of the Machine Learning web app in detail.
