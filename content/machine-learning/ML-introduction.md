Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have become a ubiquitous part of modern technology, as they help deliver insights otherwise hidden in data for improved decision making and possibly automated responses or actions. Combine AI/ML with IoT, you can now leverage the large amounts of data generated by connected devices for learning based on real-world data and apply those learnings in use cases ranging from image and speech recognition to predictive maintenance and anomaly detection.â€¯

With {{< product-c8y-iot >}} we provide a product and tooling to do exactly that:  

1. Connect machines, collect the raw machine data, and make it accessible for AI/ML model training in your data science tool of choice.
2. Focus on the operational aspects of the Machine Learning lifecycle, which involves applying a trained model to the incoming IoT data to obtain predictions, scoring, or insights in the cloud and/or at the edge.
