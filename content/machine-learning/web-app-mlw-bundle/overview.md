Machine Learning Workbench (MLW) is aimed at Data Scientists and Machine Learning Practitioners to help them solve business problems faster by streamlining the machine learning lifecycle including data capture and analysis, model training and evaluation, and model deployment. MLW provides multi-modal model building capability including easy to use, no-code graphical user interface and a programmer-friendly Jupyter Notebook based environment.

MLW provides a project-based structure for encapsulating data science assets - data, code, resources and models - along with a version control system. MLW provides visual tools to ingest and transform data produced by devices connected to Cumulocity IoT or data offloaded by [Cumulocity IoT DataHub](/datahub/datahub-overview/). In-built task scheduler can be used to orchestrate periodic data pulls or model re-training activities. Once a model is trained and evaluated, MLW allows 1-click deployment of models to [Machine Learning Engine](/machine-learning/web-app/).

The following sections will describe the features of MLW in detail.
