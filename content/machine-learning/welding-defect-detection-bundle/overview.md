Welding defect overview.

In this use case, we follow these steps:

* Download the project archive and upload it to MLW.
* Use MLW's integrated Jupyter Notebook to train a model using transfer learning and convert it to ONNX.
* Use the ONNX model along with the included pre-processing and post-processing scripts to build an inference pipeline, and deploy it to production ({{< product-c8y-iot >}} Machine Learning).
* Make inferences using the model in production.
