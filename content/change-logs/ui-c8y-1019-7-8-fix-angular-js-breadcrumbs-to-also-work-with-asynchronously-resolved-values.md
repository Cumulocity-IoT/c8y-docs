The AngularJS breadcrumbs component has been updated to properly display breadcrumbs when values are resolved asynchronously. Previously, asynchronously set values would not correctly appear in the breadcrumbs. This update ensures that breadcrumbs will now display as expected regardless of synchronous or asynchronous value resolution. In particular, this fixes breadcrumbs on "SmartREST templates" and "Device credentials" pages.
