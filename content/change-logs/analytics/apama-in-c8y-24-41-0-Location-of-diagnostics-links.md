Previously, two links for downloading diagnostics information were available at the bottom of the Streaming Analytics application.
These links have been moved. They are now available when you click the **User** button in the Streaming Analytics application to display the right drawer.
The right drawer now displays these links in a new **Diagnostics** section. See also [Downloading diagnostics and logs](/streaming-analytics/troubleshooting/#diagnostics-download).

In addition, the right drawer now also provides a **Documentation** section with links to the Streaming Analytics documentation.
