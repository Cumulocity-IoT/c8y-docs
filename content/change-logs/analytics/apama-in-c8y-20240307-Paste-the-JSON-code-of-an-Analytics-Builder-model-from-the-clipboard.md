In the Analytics Builder model manager, the **Import model** command in the toolbar has been changed to a dropdown menu. This dropdown menu contains a new **Paste** command. If you click this command and the clipboard contains valid JSON code for a model, a card for the pasted model is shown in the model manager. This change complements the accessibility enhancement that allows the JSON for an Analytics Builder model to be copied to the clipboard by allowing the JSON to be pasted back into Analytics Builder after any changes have been made.
In addition, the dropdown menu contains an **Upload** command. This has the same functionality as the **Import model** command from previous versions.
