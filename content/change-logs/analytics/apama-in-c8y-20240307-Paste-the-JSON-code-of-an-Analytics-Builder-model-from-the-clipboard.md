In the Analytics Builder model manager, the **Import model** command in the toolbar has been changed to a dropdown menu. This dropdown menu contains a new **Paste** command. If you click this command and the clipboard contains valid JSON code for a model, a card for the pasted model is shown in the model manager.
In addition, the dropdown menu contains an **Upload** command. This has the same functionality as the **Import model** command from previous versions.
