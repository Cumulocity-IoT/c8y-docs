Previously, when reactivating an Analytics Builder model, an error was thrown if a subasset of a device group or asset hierarchy from which the model receives events no longer existed in the inventory, for example, because a device was deleted.
As of this version, missing subassets in a device group or asset hierarchy are ignored and an error is no longer thrown.
However, if the deletion of a subasset results in an empty device group or asset hierarchy, an error is still thrown.
