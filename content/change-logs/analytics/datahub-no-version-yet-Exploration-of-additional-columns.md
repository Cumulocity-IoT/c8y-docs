The editor for managing additional result columns of an offloading pipeline has been enhanced with convenience tooling for exploring nested data. Using sample data retrieved from the corresponding {{< product-c8y-iot >}} base collection, you can interactively browse through the structure of the data in order to determine which specific sub-structure you want to offload.
