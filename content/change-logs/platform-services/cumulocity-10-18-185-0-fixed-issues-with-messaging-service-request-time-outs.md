Fixed an issue where requests from the core platform into the Messaging Service could take a long time to complete, slowing down the response to HTTP requests and potentially preventing the platform from handling new incoming requests. For example, a request from the core platform to publish a message using Notifications 2.0 could block if the tenant had reached its quota for unconsumed notifications, only timing out after a long delay. This issue has been resolved by ensuring that Messaging Service requests that would have blocked now time out quickly.
