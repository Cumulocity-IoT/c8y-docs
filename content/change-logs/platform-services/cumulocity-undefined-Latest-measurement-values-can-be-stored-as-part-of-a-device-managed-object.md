This feature is in Public Preview, that is, it is not enabled by default and maybe subject to change in the future.
{{< /c8y-admon-preview >}}

Support of automated persistence of measurement values under the `c8y_LatestMeasurements` fragment has been introduced. If a measurement is created with a series that matches the configuration the device managed object is updated with the last series sent to the platform.

For details on how to enable the feature and how it works, refer to the managing data section in the platform administration guide [Managing data - Cumulocity IoT documentation](https://cumulocity.com/docs/standard-tenant/managing-data/#latest-value).
