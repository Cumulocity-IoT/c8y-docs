In an effort to enhance the security and flexibility of the two-factor authentication (TFA) process, the TFA strategy can now be updated using the dedicated TFA endpoint. This change allows users to modify their TFA settings more easily and efficiently, without needing to navigate through multiple steps or menus. The updated functionality streamlines the TFA configuration process, providing a more user-friendly experience while maintaining the robust security measures that TFA offers.
