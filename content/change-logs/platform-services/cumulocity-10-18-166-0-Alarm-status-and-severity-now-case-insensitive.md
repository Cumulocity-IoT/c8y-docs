The alarm status and severity are now case-insensitive. When searching by alarm status `active` the API also returns alarms with status `ACTIVE`. The same applies for the alarm severity, that is, searching for `critical` alarms also returns `CRITICAL` alarms. Alarms with status `active` and `acknowledged` are now subject of alarm deduplication.
