As published earlier, see [release 10.15](https://cumulocity.com/releasenotes/release-10-15-0/announcements-10-15-0), Cumulocity has announced the availability of Microservice API version 2 and the deprecation of API version 1 to comply with new security requirements. Microservice API version 2 provides an improved microservice container security context restricting the invocation of privileged Linux Kernel APIs. Today Cumulocity announces the creation of alarms when subscribing a tenant to microservices still using API version 1. In Q3 2024 Microservice API version 1 will be removed from Cumulocity IoT SaaS instances and in the yearly 2025 release. If not done yet migrate your microservices to API version 2. Refer to [Microservice migration to API version 2](/microservice-sdk/general-aspects/#migration) in the user documentation to understand how to accomplish this. Otherwise your microservices in Cumulocity IoT SaaS instances may stop functioning in Q3 2024 or in environments using the yearly 2025 release.
