Previously, when an error occurred on logging in via SSO, the plain HTML error text was displayed in the browser.
With this change, optional `Redirect to the user interface application` configuration has been added which allows displaying the error text as a standard UI error message.
The new configuration parameter is optional and does not affect current SSO configurations.
Using this option requires updating the "Valid Redirect URIs" in the authorization server with the value "<tenant_domain>/apps/*". For details, refer to [Custom template configuration](/authentication/sso/custom-template).
