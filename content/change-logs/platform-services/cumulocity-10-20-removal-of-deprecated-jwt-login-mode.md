The JWT authentication with Cumulocity provider which is deprecated since version 10.6 will be removed.
This is not to be confused with SSO or OAI-Secure (OAuth-Internal) authentication, which are recommended and still supported.

Deprecated authentication using JWT token with Cumulocity provider is not supported by UI applications, tokens are generated by the client and not by Cumulocity applications.
Tokens are sent to the cumulocity using the Authorization: Bearer header.

To verify that in the environment deprecated JWT is not used needs to be verified two things, this must be done by the operations team that has access to the database:

1. Verify in the management database in tenants' collections any not empty authenticationProviders configuration exists.
2. Verify if any tenant has configured tenant options with the category "token.publicKey".

If the “authenticationProvider” or tenant option with the "token.publicKey" category exists it may indicate that a deprecated jwt is or was used in the past.
In that case, check whether external services do not use this type of authentication.
Please note that all usages of 'deprecated jwt' can be replaced with the currently supported authentication login method
using [SSO](https://cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/administration/#configuring-single-sign-on) or [authentication with external tokens](https://cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/administration/#configuring-authentication-with-oauth2-access-tokens-from-authorization-servers).
