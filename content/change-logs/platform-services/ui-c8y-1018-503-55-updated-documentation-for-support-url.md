The documentation for configuring the support URL has been updated, see [Customizing your platform](https://cumulocity.com/docs/enterprise-tenant/customization/#support-link). This update improves the clarity and completeness of the instructions for setting the support URL, which is displayed to end users in certain situations. The improved documentation should make it easier for administrators to customize the support URL as needed.
