The example phone numbers used in the Japanese translations were previously invalid and did not match the expected format for Japanese phone numbers. With this change, the example phone numbers have been updated to use a valid format that is appropriate for Japan. This improves the user experience for Japanese-speaking users by providing them with more realistic and relatable examples in the application's text and labels.
