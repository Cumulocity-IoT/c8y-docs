In the <b>Device profiles</b> page, when adding a repository item (software, firmware, configuration) if the device profile has a device type defined, the items shown either correspond to this device type or they don't have a device type specified. In some cases, repository items without a filter were not visualized in the window for adding an item. These items are now correctly shown.
