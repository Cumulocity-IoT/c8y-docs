During a large number of parallel LWM2M DTLS device connection requests, used for devices using PSK secured mode, the LWM2M agent was not able to handle all connections at the same time. This caused platform connection failures for the devices. In the LWM2M agent, the default settings for this part have been adjusted and made configurable to serve large parallel connections.
