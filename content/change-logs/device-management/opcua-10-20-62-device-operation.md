It is now possible to directly create operations for generated OPC UA devices. This does not apply to all OPC UA operations allowed for devices. Only node-specific operations can be executed on that level. General operations such as address-space scan are still only allowed on the OPC UA Server. An additional configuration (`gateway.operation.validateDeviceOperationNodes`) has been added to enable/disable a validation check if the node-specific operation is done on a node which belongs to the device. If the check is enabled the gateway executes the operation. If the node doesn't belong to the device node list an alarm is created.
