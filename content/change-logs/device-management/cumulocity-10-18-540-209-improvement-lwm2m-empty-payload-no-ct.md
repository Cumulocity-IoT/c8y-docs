The LWM2M specification permits devices to send an empty payload when there's no data to report. 
However, it doesnâ€™t specify whether a content-type should still be included in such cases. 
Previously, LWM2M agents would reject messages with an empty payload and no content-type. 
Now, these messages will be accepted and processed as intended.
