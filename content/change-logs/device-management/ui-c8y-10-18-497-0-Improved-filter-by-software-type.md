In the <b>Software</b> tab in the device details, currently the <b>Filter by software type</b> dropdown in the <b>Installed software</b> list and the <b>Install software</b> modal shows types based on existing types in the software repository. This has been changed to show only the supported software types announced by the device in its <code>c8y_SupportedSoftwareTypes</code> fragment. If a device has not announced supported software types, then again all available existing software types are listed.
