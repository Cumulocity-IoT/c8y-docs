The performance of the <code>migrateLwm2mDevices</code> operation has been improved. New command line arguments have been introduced with the operation. A list of legacy LWM2M devices can be specified directly from the shell command. Moreover, the migration of the LWM2M client registration objects can be skipped by using an argument.
