The configuration flag <code>fwResetStateMachineOnStart</code> has been added to control if the LWM2M agent resets the firmware update state machine on the client at the beginning of a firmware update. The default of this flag is <code>true</code> which matches the existing behaviour of the LWM2M agent. It is available in the [device registration settings](https://cumulocity.com/docs/protocol-integration/lwm2m/#device-registration-settings).
