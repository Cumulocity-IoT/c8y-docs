In the **Subassets** view, a "Replace device" option is now available in the context menu of  every supported device. Previously, the "Replace device" option was only available in the **All devices** page. Moreover, a **Replace device** button has been added to the "Device status" widget on the **Info** tab in the device details. This functionality does not support LWM2M devices.
