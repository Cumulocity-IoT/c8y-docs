Two new LWM2M shell commands have been added.

- The new <code>executelegacy</code> command allows LWM2M execute requests with non-standard LWM2M parameters. The behavior of this operation resembles the semantics of the existing <code>execute</code> operation until version 10.15.
- The new <code>coap</code> shell command enables making raw CoAP requests to devices to facilitate non-standard communication in exceptional cases.
