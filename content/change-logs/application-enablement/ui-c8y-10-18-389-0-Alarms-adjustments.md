The data points graph now displays alarms using either its <code>firstOccurrenceTime</code>, <code>time</code> or <code>creationTime</code> attribute instead of only using <code>creationTime</code>.
<br>Alarms are now displayed with a minimum width of one pixel, to assure that alarms with a very short duration, for example, alarms created with a CLEARED status, are displayed.
<br>The alarm tooltip in the data points graph now displays the <code>lastUpdated</code> timestamp in the user's timezone and format.
