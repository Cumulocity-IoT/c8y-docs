In a future version, we will update Angular to version 17. This update brings improvements and new features but may also introduce breaking changes that could impact your existing implementations.

To ensure a smooth transition and help you to adapt your implementations, we will provide an upgrade documentation when this change happens. This documentation will help you navigate through the changes and update your codebase accordingly.
