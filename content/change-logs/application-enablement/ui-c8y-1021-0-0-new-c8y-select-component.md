We are introducing an improved select component with new capabilities to enhance user experience and functionality. This update includes significant changes that may require action from developers.

Key Features:
- Search functionality
- Multi-select option
- Chip-based selection display
- Full keyboard support

Important Note:
The interface of the new component is not compatible with the previous version. Existing implementations using the c8y-select component will need to be updated.

Required Actions:
Developers must choose one of the following options:
1. Migrate existing c8y-select components to the new interface
2. Rename the selector to c8y-legacy-select to maintain current functionality
