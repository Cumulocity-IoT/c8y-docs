The Cockpit application was splitted into further plugins. This allows admins to tailor their cockpit application to their needs without involving any coding efforts. They can remove certain plugins and therefore features which they do not want in their cockpit application. The plugins that have now been made available are: `Cockpit widgets`, `Cockpit alarms`, `Sensor phone`, `Child devices`, `Assets navigator`, `Data point library`, `Bookmarks`, `Location`, `Add location` & `Search`.
