The Help and Service widget, which provides helpful resources and links for users, previously opened a new browser tab whenever a user clicked a link that redirected to the current application they were using. This behavior could lead to multiple unnecessary tabs being opened. With this change, the widget now detects if the link points to the current application and opens it in the same tab instead. This improves the user experience by reducing tab clutter and making navigation within the application smoother.
