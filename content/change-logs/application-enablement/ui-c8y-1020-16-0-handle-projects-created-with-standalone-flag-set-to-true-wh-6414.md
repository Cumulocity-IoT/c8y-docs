Previously, adding {{< product-c8y-iot >}} schematics to Angular projects initialized with the standalone flag set to true failed. This issue has been addressed. Now, when integrating {{< product-c8y-iot >}} schematics into standalone Angular projects, the standalone flag is automatically set to false. Full support for standalone projects will be implemented in future updates. This interim solution allows developers to use {{< product-c8y-iot >}} schematics with projects initially set up as standalone, though with standalone features disabled.
