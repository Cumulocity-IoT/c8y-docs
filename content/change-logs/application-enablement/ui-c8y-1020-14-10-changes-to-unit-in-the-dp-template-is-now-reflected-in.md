In the past, when changing the unit of a data point template, the change was not reflected in the "Info gauge" widgets which were using this data point. This inconsistent behavior has now been fixed. Now, whenever the unit is updated in a data point template, this change will also be immediately visible in the respective "Info gauge" widgets.
