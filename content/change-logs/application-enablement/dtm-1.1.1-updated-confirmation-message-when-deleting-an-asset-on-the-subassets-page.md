On the **Subassets** page, the confirmation message when deleting an asset has been updated to: 'You are about to delete: "<<asset_name>>" and all its subassets. This operation is irreversible.' Additionally, the checkbox message has been revised to: 'Also delete all devices inside "<<asset_name>>"'.
