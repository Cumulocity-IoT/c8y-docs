In some cases, datapoints with a configured maximum value of 0 were not displayed correctly in the range display of dashboards and other visualizations. This issue has been resolved and the range display now correctly shows the value for datapoints with a maximum of 0. This change improves the accuracy and consistency of data visualizations for all users.
