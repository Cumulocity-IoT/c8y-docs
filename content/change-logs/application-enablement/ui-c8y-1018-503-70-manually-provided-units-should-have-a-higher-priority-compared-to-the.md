In some cases, users want to override the units of a datapoint with a custom unit. Previously, the datapoint unit had a higher priority than the manually specified unit, which was not the desired behavior. With this change, manually provided units now have a higher priority compared to the actual datapoint units. This ensures that the custom unit specified by the user is always used instead of the default datapoint unit.
