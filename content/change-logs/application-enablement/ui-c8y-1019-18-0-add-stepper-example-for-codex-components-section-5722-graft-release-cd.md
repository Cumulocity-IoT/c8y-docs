As part of enhancing the Codex components section and providing more comprehensive examples, a stepper example has been added. The stepper component allows users to divide content into logical steps, guiding them through a process or a series of fields they need to complete. This change improves the documentation and makes it easier for users to understand and utilize the stepper component in their own projects.
