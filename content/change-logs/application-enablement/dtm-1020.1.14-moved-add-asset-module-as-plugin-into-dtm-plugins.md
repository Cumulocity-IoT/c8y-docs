The **Add Asset** module has been moved from the Digital Twin Manager (DTM) application to the newly created DTM plugins component. This component consists of modules from DTM as official plugins, enabling their integration into default and custom web applications. The **Add Asset** button will continue to be available in the standard DTM interface.
