Dashboard widgets previously took their minimum width from a styling rule that disagreed with the dashboard grid, so widgets could end up at inconsistent widths when resized. The minimum size is now controlled by the grid itself, so widgets resize predictably and keep a consistent minimum across dashboard layouts.
