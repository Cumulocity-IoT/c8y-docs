Previously, when a dashboard was copied and pasted, any linked child additions from the source dashboard were not included in the pasted version. This has now been changed so that the linked child additions are also copied over to the pasted dashboard. This improvement ensures that the pasted dashboard includes all relevant information and linked assets from the original, providing a more complete and consistent user experience when duplicating dashboards.
