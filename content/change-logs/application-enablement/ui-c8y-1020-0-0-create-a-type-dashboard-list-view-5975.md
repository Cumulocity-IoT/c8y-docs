A dashboard manager view has been added. This dashboard manager shows a list of device type dashboards by aggregating all dashboards that have a device type assigned. Dashboards can be removed via the list. Moreover you can view all devices that have access to a particular dashboard. Dashboards can be edited by navigating to the device view.
