In the past, restoring a dashboard did not properly update the node property of the navigator, leading to inconsistencies. This has now been fixed. The navigator node property is correctly changed after a dashboard restore, ensuring the restored dashboard matches the expected state. This improvement provides a more reliable and consistent user experience when restoring dashboards.
