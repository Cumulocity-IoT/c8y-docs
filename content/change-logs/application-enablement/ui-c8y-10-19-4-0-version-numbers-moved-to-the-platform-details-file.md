The version numbers for the frontend and backend are no longer displayed in the platform UI. Instead, details on all components can be downloaded via the \*\*Download platform details\*\* button. This change was motivated by a component split resulting in many different components following different version number schemes. However, custom apps developed with the Web SDK may show a default version number if desired. Support requests should now always include the platform details information.
