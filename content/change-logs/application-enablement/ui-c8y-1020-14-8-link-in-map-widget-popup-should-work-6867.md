"Map" widgets allow displaying geographic information in dashboards. However, links included in the popup of a "Map" widget were not working when clicked, preventing users from accessing additional information or navigating to other relevant pages. This issue has been resolved. Links in "Map" widget popups now work as expected when clicked.
