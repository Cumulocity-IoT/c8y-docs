The grid used in dashboards for placing widgets now supports 24 instead of 12 columns. This allows finer-grained positioning of widgets on dashboards. In case you share the same dashboards between different application versions, we strongly recommend you to upgrade to a version that includes the fix <b>MTM-55923</b>.
