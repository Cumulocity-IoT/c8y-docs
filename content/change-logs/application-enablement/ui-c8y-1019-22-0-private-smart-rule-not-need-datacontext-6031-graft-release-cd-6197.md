In the past, private smart rules had the property `contextData` in `c8y_Context`, even if the rule did not use it. This is no longer required. Private smart rules can now be created without the `contextData` property, to avoid storing redundant data in the database. This change only affects the creation of new private smart rules. Existing smart rules are not impacted.
