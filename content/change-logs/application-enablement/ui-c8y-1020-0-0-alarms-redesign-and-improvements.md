In a future version, we are introducing redesigned alarms with both visual and functional enhancements.

**Visual and UX Enhancements**:

* We have redesigned the way alarms are displayed in the "Alarms" view and widgets.

**Functional Improvements**:

* The "Alarms" view now shows only a single list of alarms, where filters can be applied.
* We have introduced a details section, which contains all information related to the alarm.
* The functionalities of the "Alarm list", "All critical alarms", and "Recent alarms" widgets have been merged into a single, comprehensive widget called "Alarm list".
* The Alarm list widget has been migrated to Angular.
* Real-time functionality has been replaced with Auto refresh.
