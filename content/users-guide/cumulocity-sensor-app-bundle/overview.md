The Cumulocity IoT Sensor App is a free smartphone application available for iOS and Android smartphones. It is the successor of the previous Cloud Sensor App.

The app is designed to collect measurements from your smartphone and nearby Bluetooth device sensors and send them to the Cumulocity IoT platform. It has a straightforward registration workflow to get you up and running quickly and provides an easy way to get data into Cumulocity IoT.

If you are using the Cumulocity IoT free trial available via Software AG Cloud, the app ideally helps you to quickly get familiar with the platform as it provides an easy way to connect devices and sensors. Capturing data from Bluetooth devices with Cumulocity IoT moreover saves a lot of implementation effort.

Besides sending data to the platform, the Cumulocity IoT Sensor App can also send commands to the smartphone directly from the phone dashboard. Commands currently available in the dashboard include alert messages and vibration.

Supported smartphone sensors include:

*   Accelerometer and motion sensor
*   Gyroscope
*   Barometer
*   Magnetometer and compass
*   GPS locationÂ 
*   Microphone and voice

> **Info:** The app only works with sensors supported by your smartphone's hardware which provide official APIs. Depending on platform support, additional sensors may be added in future releases.

The latest list of supported Bluetooth devices is provided in the app. A button to take you to this page can be found when scanning for new devices. Currently the app supports the following devices:

*   Texas Instruments Sensor Tag
*   Acaia Lunar Scale
*   Cinco Scale
*   CirrusSense Pressure Sensor

Additional devices will be supported in the future and made available in the app.

> **Info:** The Barista.io demo demonstrates the use of connected weight and pressure sensors to brew the perfect coffee. The demo sends measurements from up to 4 connected Bluetooth devices to Cumulocity IoT in real time.
