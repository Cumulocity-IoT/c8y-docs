The microservice-based Data Broker is powered by the Cumulocity Messaging Service that enables reliable, scalable and high-performance movement of IoT data. The microservice-based Data Broker is similar to the existing Data Broker in its functionality except that it needs a special microservice, known as Data-Broker microservice, to be enabled to make use of it.

> **Important:** Please note that in this release the Cumulocity Messaging Service and the microservice-based Data Broker are available on a limited trial basis, and not yet enabled in all Cumulocity public cloud environments. Please contact Cumulocity customer support or your Software AG sales representative to inquire about using these capabilities in your Cumulocity environment. The original Data Broker will continue to operate alongside the microservice-based Data Broker for the time being. Users can choose which Data Broker to use on a per-tenant basis.

### <a name="enabling-ms-data-broker"></a> To Enable the microservice-based Data Broker

1. As a management tenant, navigate to Administration > Tenants > Subtenants & select the tenant that will serve as the source of the data connector.
2. Click on the Applications tab and subscribe the tenant to `databroker-agent-server`.

### <a name="troubleshooting-ms-data-broker"></a> Troubleshooting

#### Management tenant subscription alert

The management tenant cannot be used as a data broker source tenant & this alarm is raised when trying to subscribe a management tenant to the data broker agent.

#### Data Broker connection error

The data broker agent is configured to monitor each connector for the number of failed forwarding requests sent. If this number reaches a configured threshold a CRITICAL alarm is raised in the tenant. 
If this happens the data will be stored until the connection is restored and it can be forwarded again.
Failed requests can happen in the event the data broker subscriber tenant becomes unreachable.

#### Data Broker slow processing alert

The data broker agent is configured to monitor the rate at which events are being delivered to their destination. If events cannot be delivered fast enough, slow processing alarms will be raised. A slow processing alarm includes a connector id to help identify which destination tenant is affected.

##### Queue Backlog 

This alarm is raised when latency for message delivery crosses a specified threshold. This usually happens if there is a backlog of undelivered events to the destination tenant due to various factors.
 
##### Average request bytes sent per second 

The data broker monitors the data rate at which events are being forwarded. If this rate is lower than a configured threshold, a slow processing alert will be raised. This can occur due to a slow network.
