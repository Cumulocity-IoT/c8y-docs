The Data Broker 2.0 is powered by the all-new Cumulocity Messaging Service that enables reliable, scalable and high-performance movement of IoT data. The Data Broker 2.0 is similar to the existing Data Broker in its functionality except that it needs a special microservice, known as Data-Broker microservice, to be enabled to make use of it.
