In order to use the single sign-on feature for enterprise tenants, the enterprise domain must be set up as redirect URI in the basic configurations.
For more details see [Changing settings > Configuring single sign-on](/guides/users-guide/administration#single-sign-on) under Administration.

If single sign-on providers have whitelists, the enterprise domain should be whitelisted.
