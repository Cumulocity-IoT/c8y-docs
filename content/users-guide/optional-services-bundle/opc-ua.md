The OPC UA device gateway is a stand-alone Java program that communicates with OPC UA server(s) and the Cumulocity platform. It stores data into the Cumulocity database via REST. Additionally, C8Y commands are executed to perform various operations on the OPC UA servers. 

The gateway has to be registered as Cumulocity device in a specific tenant and the opcua-device-gateway must run in the users’ environment. 

>**Important:** In order to use OPC UA, you must be subscribed to the “opcua-mgmt-service” microservice. If the “opcua-mgmt-service” microservice is not available in your tenant, contact [SAG support](https://empower.softwareag.com/ContactSupport/).

To download the gateway navigate to [Cumulocity resources.](http://resources.cumulocity.com/examples/opcua-device-gateway-1005.7.1.jar)

The gateway requires Java 8 in order to run.

> **Info**: The documentation of the OPCUA Java gateway 1.0 can be found in the Java agent sources in Bitbucket at [https://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-agents-opc/src/develop/opcua-agent/documentation/](https://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-agents-opc/src/develop/opcua-agent/documentation/). Note, that this version is deprecated and should only be used for demo purposes. For production usage, use the new OPC UA agent described in this document.  

### <a name="gateway-register"></a>Gateway configuration and registration

YAML file and spring profiles are used for the configuration of the gateway. A default configuration file is embedded in the gateway JAR file, so you only need to set the properties which are different from the default. For more information on the YAML syntax, see [https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml/src/default/](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml/src/default/). 

> **Important**: When editing the YAML file, make sure to provide valid indentations.

To run the gateway locally, the default settings should be overridden in a customized profile. To use the customized profile, create a YAML file which must follow the naming convention:

    application-<<Profile_name>>.yaml

For example, to connect to a tenant, first a profile named *application-myTenant.yaml* will be created. The following properties will be added to the file:

```bash
C8Y:
    baseUrl: https://<<yourTenant>>.cumulocity.com
gateway:
    bootstrap:
        tenantId: <<yourTenantId>>
    identifier: Gateway_Device
    name: My Gateway
    db:
# The gateway uses the local database to store platform credentials and local cache. This parameter shows the location in which the local data should be stored.
        baseDir: C:/Users/<<userName>>/.opcua/data
```

> **Info:** Windows OS is used for the example.

Depending on your OS, the file must be saved to one of the following directories:

```
Windows OS
    /C:/opcua/
Linux OS
    /etc/opcua/
    /etc/opcua/data
Mac OS
    /opt/opcua/
    /opt/opcua/data
```

The number of profiles you may have is not limited. To use a specific profile on runtime, the "-Dspring.profiles.active" JVM argument has to be passed when running the gateway JAR file. For example, let’s use the previously created profile. Start a terminal and use the following command: 

```bash
java -Dspring.profiles.active=default,myTenant -jar opcua-device-gateway-<<version>>.jar
```
The command above will start a gateway with the default profile and it will override the default properties with the properties defined in the “myTenant” profile.

**Optional**: To specify your own configuration, Spring arguments can be used in your terminal to run the gateway JAR file. Multiple locations have to be comma-separated. The configuration locations should be either YAML files or directories. In case of directories, they must end with “/”. For example:

```bash
java -jar opcua-device-gateway-<<version>>.jar --spring.config.location=file:<<location>>/.opcua/conf/application-myTenant.yaml,file:<<location>>/.opcua/conf/
```

If both arguments "--spring.config.location" and "-Dspring.profiles.active" are provided, the configuration locations should be directories instead of files. Otherwise, the profile-specific variants will not be considered.


#### Additional customizations

> **Info**: If no additional customizations are required, you can skip this section.

The following properties can be manually configured in the YAML file:

```bash
# Name of the application - this should not change
name: opcua-device-gateway
# Platform location and configuration
C8Y:
  baseUrl: http://localhost
  forceInitialHost: true

gateway:
# Gateway version - this is filled automatically during the build process - do not change this property
  version: ${project.version}
# The following two properties will be set to the name of the computer that is running the gateway unless it's overridden manually
  identifier: mygateway
  name: mygateway
  db:
# The gateway uses the local database to store platform credentials and local cache. This parameter shows the location in which the local data should be stored.
    baseDir: ${user.home}/.opcua/data

# Credentials for device bootstrap - enter tenant that gateway should register to.
  bootstrap:
# ID of the tenant to which the device will be registered. 
    tenantId: management
    username: devicebootstrap
    password: <devicebootstrap user password>
# On start, the gateway will wait <delay> milliseconds before connecting to the platform and searching for a      device.
    delay: 5000
# If true then gateway will drop stored device credentials and fetch them from platform
    force: false

# Scheduled tasks and thread pools configuration. Unless required, modifying these properties is not recommended.

    validityTime: 3650
```

#### Logging

Custom logging configuration can be set during startup by passing the "-Dlogging.config" jvm argument. For more info on how to set up custom logging settings, refer to the “Logback” documentation.

### Running the Gateway

The gateway can run with either default or custom settings. To run the gateway run one of the commands below:

* Default settings and default logging configuration: 

		java -jar opcua-device-gateway-<<version>>.jar

* Custom settings and default logging configuration: 

		java -Dspring.profiles.active=default,PROFILE_NAME -jar opcua-device-gateway-<<version>>.jar

* Custom settings and custom logging configuration:

		java -Dlogging.config=file:PATH_TO_LOGBACK_XML -Dspring.profiles.active=default,PROFILE_NAME -jar opcua-device-gateway-<<version>>.jar

For example, using the profile from the previous section we are going to register the gateway. First, open the terminal and navigate to the location of the gateway.jar file. Next, enter the following command: 

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=default,myTenant -jar opcua-device-gateway-<<version>>.jar
```
Navigate to the **Registration** page and click **Register device > General device registration**. Enter the Identifier name (in our example it is “Gateway_Device”) and then click **Next**.

Click **Accept** to complete the registration.

![Device Registration](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-device-registration.png)

### Connecting the gateway to the server

Next, establish a connection between the gateway and the OPC UA server. 

1. In the **OPC UA server** tab of the respective gateway, click **Add server**. <br>
![Add new server](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-new-server.png)
2. Use the **Server connection** toggle, to enable or disable the server connection. 
3. Enter the **Server URL** which is used to establish a connection between the server and the gateway. 
4. Enter the **Timeout value** in seconds. The timeout value is calculated for each request. If the timeout value is exceeded the request will be unsuccessful. 
5. Enter the **Status check interval** in seconds. The platform constantly checks whether there is incoming data. If the status check interval value is exceeded an alarm is created. The status check interval value has to be greater than the monitoring value of the gateway. 
6. Select the **Security mode** and **Security policy** depending on the server configuration. For more info, see the [section below](#security-modes).
7. Select the desired authentication method. For more info, see the [section below](#authentication).
8. Click **Save**.

> **Info:** Once a connection is established, the servers will be located in the **Child devices** tab. In there, the servers will contain additional data such as access to the address space. 

#### <a name="security-modes"></a> Security modes

The security mode settings tell the gateway how it should secure the connection between itself and the OPC UA server. When a mode other than NONE is selected, the gateway will auto-generate a self-signed application instance certificate and will use it to connect to the server. Possible security mode options are:

- NONE
- BASIC128RSA15_SIGN
- BASIC128RSA15_SIGN_ENCRYPT
- BASIC256_SIGN
- BASIC256_SIGN_ENCRYPT
- BASIC256SHA256_SIGN
- BASIC256SHA256_SIGN_ENCRYPT

> **Info:** The security modes have nothing to do with authorization or authentication! The security mode tells the gateway how the connection should be secured and whether the connection should be encrypted or not.

### <a name="authentication"></a> Authentication

The authentication setting is used to authenticate and authorize the server user. It tells the gateway how to create a user identity and how to send it to the OPC UA server when establishing a connection. The following authentication methods can be selected:

- Anonymous - Anonymous connection will only work when the OPC UA server allows such connections. 
- Username/Password - With this setting the gateway will connect to the server as a specific user represented by a username and password.
- Key-based authentication - The gateway will use an existing certificate to authenticate as a specific user. JKS keystore must be uploaded to Cumulocity as a binary with type “application/octet-stream”. This keystore must follow the following rules:
    - It has to be a Java keystore (JKS).
    - The keystore itself has to be password-protected.
    - The keystore has to contain user certificate with  “opcuauser” alias.
    - The user certificate has to be password-protected.

The keystore can be create via the following Java keytool command:

```bash
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias opcuauser -keystore keystore.jks -storepass passw0rd_a -validity 3600 -keysize 2048
```
![terminal](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-terminal.png)

The keystore can then be verified by using a tool like KeystoreExplorer. 

![Keystore explorer](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-keystore-explorer1.png)


![Keystore explorer2](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-keystore-explorer2.png)

The keystore can then be uploaded as binary in Cumulocity and it can be used in the server configuration.

![Opcua Keystore](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-keystore.png)

### Gateway device details

In this section, only OPC UA specific information related to the tabs in the device details page will be explained. For more info on all tabs, see [Device Management > Device Details](/users-guide/device-management/#device-details) in the User guide.

![Gateway device details](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-device-details.png)

#### Child devices 

All server connections are listed as child devices even if the servers are disconnected. To stop a server connection, either delete the server child device or disable/remove the connection from the **OPC UA server** tab.

![Gateway child devices](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-server-child-device.png)

#### Measurements

The Measurements tab provides visualization of data in the form of charts. In total the gateway contains the following six charts:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col span="1" style="width: 20%;">
<col span="1" style="width: 80%;">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Charts</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">Connected servers</td>
<td align="left">Provides the number of connected and disconnected servers.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">Gateway active threads</td>
<td align="left">Shows the number of active threads for the alarm/measurements/event flushes and for the executor. You can also see whether the threadpool size limit is not sufficient, based on the threadpool configurations in the gateway. If the maximum threadpool size is reached then any new activities which require a new thread will be blocked until a thread is available. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">Gateway cyclic reads</td>
<td align="left">Number of active cyclic reads done by the gateway. Cyclic reads are actively reading from the OPC UA server within an interval based on the configuration of the device protocol.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">Gateway memory</td>
<td align="left">Represents the “free”,”max” and “allocated” memory values of the gateway.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">Gateway repository queues</td>
<td align="left">Before a thread is flushed it is first added to the queue. This chart shows how many threads are currently in the queue. </td>
</tr>

<td align="left">Server response time</td>
<td align="left">Shows the response time of each currently connected server. </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

![Gateway measurements tab](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-gateway-memory.png)

#### Alarms

The **Alarms** tab shows all alarms raised either in the gateway or in the servers. In total there are three alarms which can be raised:

- Connection loss - If the gateway fails to connect to the OPC UA server a critical alarm is raised.
- Gateway crash -  If the gateway crashes or is abruptly shut down a major alarm is raised.
- No data arrived within interval - If the status interval check value in the OPC UA server configuration is exceeded a major alarm is raised.

![Gateway alarms tab](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-alarms.png)

#### Events

The **Events** tab shows all events related to the gateway-server connection. Additionally, you can see when the gateway has started and when it ends. 

![Gateway events tab](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-events.png)

#### Address space

The **Address space** tab shows the attributes and references of the address space node of the servers. The filter searches through the whole hierarchy to find “nodeId”, “browserName” or “displayName” of an attribute. In case of multiple “ancestorNodeIds”, you can click on the desired node to be redirected.

The address space is automatically scanned when a connection between the gateway and the server is established. The duration of the scan depends on the size of the address space. The address space information is stored locally once it is scanned and then used by this applying process. If the address space information is not yet available, e.g. the address space has not been scanned, another scan will be triggered without synchronizing data into Cumulocity. Performing another address space operation will update the address space information.

![Gateway events tab](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-address.png)

### Device protocols

#### Adding a new device protocol

1. Click **New device protocol** in the top menu bar and select OPC UA as device protocol type. 
2. In the resulting dialog box, enter a name and an optional description for the device protocol.
3. Optionally, a reference server can be selected. Selecting a reference server allows you to create device types based on the OPC UA model stored on an OPC UA server. This greatly simplifies the mapping process, as device types can be created based on OPC UA browse paths being actually present on the server.
4. Click **Create**.<br>
![Add new device protocol](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-add-protocol.png)

	> **Info:** Selecting a reference server will require you to select a reference node.

Once the device protocol is created, various configuration settings such as variables, data reporting and constraints can be applied. Initially, the device protocol will be inactive. When active, the gateway will scan the address space of all servers and will automatically apply the device protocol to all nodes which match the criteria. When the device protocol is configured, click **Save**. 

#### Adding a new variable

1. Click **Add variable** under the **Variables** section. 
2. Enter the path and the name of the variable. 
3. Choose either the default or the custom data reporting. The default option uses the data reporting mechanism used in the device protocol. The custom option will let you configure a data reporting mechanism only for the current variable. 
4. Additionally, different functionalities such as sending measurements, creating alarms, sending events and custom actions for each variable can be selected. 
5. Click **Save** to save your settings. 

The gateway has a scheduling job and after the variables are saved, the gateway will check whether the variables exist under the subtree of the node. Afterwards, for each node a child device of the server is created. The child devices will contain data based on the configuration of the device protocol. The node child devices will also be listed in the **All devices** page. 

> **Info:** If no reference server was selected during the device protocol creation, the path should be given with a namespace URI representation. In the OPC UA server the index value can be taken from the namespace array. An example namespace URI representation for browse path “5:Counter1” would be: *http://www.prosysopc.com/OPCUA/SimulationNodes:Counter1*. Node id equal to “ns=5;s=Simulation” will have the following namespace representation *'nsu=http://www.prosysopc.com/OPCUA/SimulationNodes;s=Simulation*. In both examples the server’s namespace array, the 5th element has the value of “http://www.prosysopc.com/OPCUA/SimulationNodes”.

![OPC UA device protocol](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-device-protocol.png)

The functionalities that can be enabled are the following:

**Send measurement**

Turn on **Send measurement** to specify a measurement. 

Specify the following parameters:

- Enter the type of the measurement, for example, “c8y_AccelerationMeasurement”.
- Series are any fragments in measurements that contain a “value” property. For example, “c8y_AccelerationMeasurement.acceleration”.
- The **Unit** field specifies the unit of the given measurement, for example, “m/s” for velocity.

**Create alarm**

Turn on **Create alarm** if you want to create an alarm out of the resource. 

Specify the following parameters (all mandatory):
 
- Severity - one of CRITICAL, MAJOR, MINOR, WARNING
- Type
- Status - one of ACTIVE, ACKNOWLEDGED, CLEARED
- Text

**Send Event**

Turn on Send event to send an event each time you receive a resource value. 

Specify the following parameters:

- Enter the type of the event. For example, “com_cumulocity_model_DoorSensorEvent”.
- Enter the text which will be sent. For example, “Door sensor was triggered”.

**Custom Actions**

Custom actions are HTTP POST requests which the gateway will send to a defined custom URL. You can define custom headers and body template with the following placeholders available:

- ${value} - value of specific node
- ${serverId} - ID of OPC-UA server
- ${nodeId} - ID of source node
- ${deviceId} - ID of source device 

Below there is an example of a full device type that configures a custom action:

```
{
   "name": "My device type for HttpPost",
   "referencedServerId": "{serverId}",
   "referencedRootNodeId": "ns=2;s=HelloWorld/Dynamic",
   "enabled": true,
   "subscriptionType" : {
     "type": "Subscription",
     "subscriptionParameters": {
       "samplingRate": 1000
     }
   },
   "applyConstraints": {
     "matchesNodeIds": [
       "ns=2;s=HelloWorld/Dynamic1"
     ]
   },
   "mappings": [
       {
           "browsePath": [
               "2:Double"
           ],
           "customAction": {
               "type": "HttpPost",
               "endpoint": "http://my.endpoint.local",
               "bodyTemplate": "{\"text\": \"I am coming from Http POST, value: ${value} \", \"type\": \"HttpPostMO\"}",
               "headers": {
                   "Authorization": "Basic MYAUTHCREDENTIALS==",
                   "Content-Type": "application/json"
               }
           }
       }
   ]
}
```

### Data reporting

There are three data reporting mechanisms which can be applied to read all mapped browse paths:

- None - The gateway will not read values automatically. The mappings will be applied only when manual read operations are performed on mapped nodes.
- Cyclic Read - The gateway reads values from mapped nodes at specified interval rates in milliseconds. The minimum allowed rate is 50 milliseconds.

![OPC UA device protocol](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-data-reporting-cyclic-read.png)

- Subscription - The gateway retrieves values by using OPC UA's own subscription mechanism.
Possible parameters:
  - Sampling interval (required): The sampling interval defines a time interval individually for each mapped node. This is the rate at which the server checks the data source for changes.
  - Queue size (required): The size of the queue where it holds the samples before reporting. If you wish to record samples at a faster rate than reporting interval, you will also need to reserve a longer queue size, to be able to keep all the samples in the server. Reporting interval is defined for the gateway which is configurable in yaml file and is 100 ms by default.
    - Discard: Select whether oldest or newest item to be discarded in case of the samples are exceeding the queue size.
  - Data change trigger:
    - Status: Triggers notification if node's status has changed
    - Status/Value: Triggers notification if node's status or value has changed.
    - Status/Value/Timestamp: Triggers notification if node's status, value or timestamp has changed.
  - Deadband filter: Deadband filter makes notified data values to be filtered.
    - None: This option is selected by default. This means no filter will be applied. 
    - Absolute: If an absolute deadband filter is chosen, the value will contain the absolute change in a data value that will cause a notification to be generated. This parameter applies only to variables with any number data type. 
    - Percent: If percent deadband value is chosen, the value is defined as the percentage of the EU range. It applies only to analog items with a valid EU range property. This range is multiplied with the deadband value and is then compared to the actual value change in order to determine the need for a data change notification.

![OPC UA device protocol](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-data-reporting-subscription.png)

#### Applying constraints

Specifying auto-apply constraints allows you to limit the scope in which the device types are applied, for example by specifying a set of possible servers or node IDs. If no constraints are set, device types are applied at any fitting location on the OPC UA server.

The following constraints can be applied:

- **Limit device type to a set of servers** - Limit the device types to a particular set of servers. This is useful if you want to have 1 device type for each OPC UA server. Simply click on the dropdown menu and select the desired servers.
- **Limit device type scope in the address space** - Limit the scope to servers which have the entered path in their address space.
- **Limit device type to servers with a certain fragment** - The device protocol will only be available to the servers which have the entered fragment.
- **Limit device type to specific root nodes ID** - A list of “root” node IDs (from which your browsePath is defined) to which the device type should be applied. For example, if there is only one server and the device type is applied to two node IDs, two child devices of the server will be created. Note that if the device type variables do not exist in the root nodes, the device type will not be applied to the root node server.

![OPC UA device protocol](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-auto-constraints.png)

### Operations

Cumulocity operations is the interface that is used to tell the gateway what to do and how to do it. This section describes all operations that are currently supported by the gateway. 

#### Scanning the address space

This operation triggers importing address space for a specific OPC-UA server. The server’s ID is passed as a device ID. The gateway will scan the entire address space of the server and persist a twinned representation of the address space in the Cumulocity platform.

```
POST /devicecontrol/operations/

	{
	"deviceId": "<server-device-Id>",
	"c8y_ua_command_ScanAddressSpace": {
	        “skipSync”: false
	    },
	"description": "Import address space from root node"
	}
```

The twinned address space information is persisted in the Cumulocity inventory. It is internally used to support address space browsing and to define device types. Hence this operation is always triggered if a new server is added to the platform.

Once the device gateway knows the address space, it uses it to handle different logics, for example applying device types to nodes. So if you already have the address space scanned once and stored in Cumulocity, you might want the device gateway to learn one more time about server’s address space without synchronizing data into Cumulocity. To achieve that, provide “skipSync”: true.

> **Info:** We do not recommend to directly work with the persisted address space data structures in the Cumulocity inventory, as these might change in the future. Use the endpoints of the management service to interact with the OPC UA address space.

#### Reading the value of a node/nodes

This operation reads the value attribute of specific node or list of nodes.

```
POST /devicecontrol/operations/

	{
	  "deviceId" : "<server-device-Id>",
	  "c8y_ua_command_ReadValue": {
		"nodes": ["NODE_ID"],
	     “timestampsToReturn”: “Neither”   
	  },
	  "description":"read value"
	}
```

Other possible values for `timestampsToReturn`: “Source”, “Server” or “Both”.

The result of this operation will contain output in the following format:

```
{
	"results": {
		"ns=2;s=MyLevel": {
			"13": {
				"value": {
					"value": 77.0
				},
				"statusCode": 0,
				"sourcePicoseconds": 0,
				"serverPicoseconds": 0
			}
		}
	}
}
```

#### Reading all attributes of a node

This operation returns all attributes of specific node.

```
{
	"deviceId": "<server-device-Id>",
	"c8y_ua_command_ReadNodeAttributes": {
		"node": "ns=2;s=MyEnumObject"
	},
	"description": "Read node attributes"
}
```

The result may differ depending on the node type.

```
{
	"Value": {
		"value": 1
	},
	"DataType": "ns=2;s=MyEnumType",
	"ValueRank": -1,
	"AccessLevel": 3,
	"UserAccessLevel": 3,
	"MinimumSamplingInterval": -1.0,
	"Historizing": false,
	"DisplayName": "MyEnumObject",
	"WriteMask": 0,
	"UserWriteMask": 0
}
```

#### Reading an attribute

This operation supports to read one or more attributes of one or more nodes. This includes support of the range parameter to read a single element or a range of elements when the attribute value is an array.

```
{
    "deviceId": "<server-device-Id>",
    "c8y_ua_command_ReadAttribute": {
   	  "nodes": ["ns=3;s=FloatArray"],
   	  "attribute":"13"
    }
    "description": "Read attribute from ns=3;s=FloatArray",
}
```

The result may differ depending on the node type.
```
{
	"results": {
		"ns=3;s=FloatArray": {
			"13": {
				"value": {
					"value": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
				},
				"statusCode": 0,

The index ranges given below are according to the OPC UA specifications and will be transformed to NumericRange. 

The syntax is as following:

```
    NumericRange: <dimension> [',' <dimension>]
    <dimension>: <index> [':' <index>]
```


```
{
    "description": "Read attribute from ns=3;s=FloatArray",
    "deviceId": "<server-device-Id>",
    "c8y_ua_command_ReadAttribute": {
   	  "nodes": ["ns=3;s=FloatArray"],
   	  "attribute":"13",
   	  "ranges":"0:1"
    }
}
```

The result may differ depending on the node type.

```
{
    "results": {
   	 "ns=3;s=FloatArray": {
   		 "13": {
   			 "value": {
   				 "value": [1.0, 2.0]
   			 },
   			 "statusCode": 0,
   			 "sourceTimestamp": 1566572540173,
   			 "sourcePicoseconds": 0,
   			 "serverTimestamp": 1566574513935,
   			 "serverPicoseconds": 0
   		 }
   	 }
    }
}
```

#### Historic read

This operation reads history values and applies the mappings except of alarm mappings.

```
{
    "deviceId": "<server-device-Id>",    
    "c8y_ua_command_HistoricReadOperation": {
   	 "nodeId": "ns=2;s=MyLevel",
       "processMappings": true,
   	 "dateFrom": "2019-06-13T10:43:00+02:00",
   	 "dateTo": "2019-06-13T10:52:00+02:00",
   	 "tagType": "TAG"
    },
    "description": "Historic read"
}
```

- tagType - Possible tagType values are “TAG” and “NO_TAG”. "TAG" appends “_Historic” for both the mapping types and for the measurement mappings.
- processMappings (optional) - by default the value is true. If the value is false then the values will not be processed based on the device type mapping. 

#### Historic data binary upload

his operation reads historic values and only saves those values to a file which can be retrieved using the binary API.

```
{
    "deviceId": "<server-device-Id>",
    "c8y_ua_command_HistoricDataUploadOperation": {
   	 "nodeId": "ns=2;s=MyLevel",
   	 "dateFrom": "2019-01-03T09:53:00+02:00",
   	 "dateTo": "2019-06-13T18:53:00+02:00",
   	 "chunkSize": 1,
   	 "compress": true
    },
    "description": "Upload history data"
}
```

The binary file representations, which can be queried using binary API, are created with the type “c8y_ua_HistoricData” and an operationId with the value of the operation with which it has been generated.

#### Write value

This operation writes values to the node/nodes.

```
{
	"deviceId": "<server-device-Id>",
	"c8y_ua_command_WriteValue": {
		"values": {
			"ns=3;s=LocalizedText": {
				"value": "This is a localized text"
			},
			"ns=3;s=Double": {
				"value": "3.14159"
			}
		}
	},
	"description": "Write values to different nodes"
}
```

#### Write attribute

This operation is similar to the previous one, but instead of writing to the value attribute, this operation writes attributes’ values to any writable attributes. The following example writes two different attributes to two different nodes.

```
{
	"deviceId": "<server-device-Id>",
	"c8y_ua_command_WriteAttribute": {
		"values": {
			"ns=3;s=LocalizedText": {
				"attribute": "13",
				"value": "This is a localized text"
			},
			"ns=3;s=Double": {
				"attribute": "13",
				"value": "3.14159"
			}
		}
	},
	"description": "Write attributes’ values to different attributes of different nodes"
}
```

Optionally, it is possible to write a value range when the attribute value is an array. 

```
{
	"deviceId": "<server-device-Id>",
	"c8y_ua_command_WriteAttribute": {
		"values": {
			"ns=3;s=FloatArray": {
				"attribute": "13",
				"ranges": "0:1",
				"value": "2.0,4.0"
			}
		}
	},
	"description": "Write attribute value to array attribute"
}
```

#### Get method description

This operation reads the description of a method node. 

```
{
	"deviceId": "<server-device-Id>",
	"c8y_ua_command_GetMethodDescriptionOperation": {
		"nodeId": "ns=2;s=MyMethod"
	},
	"description": "get method description"
}
```

The result describes a method, it’s parent object, input and output arguments.

```
{
	"nodeId": "ns=2;s=MyMethod",
	"name": "MyMethod",
	"parentNodeId": "ns=2;s=MyDevice",
	"parentName": "MyDevice",
	"inputArguments": [{
			"name": "Operation",
			"description": "The operation to perform on parameter: valid functions are sin, cos, tan, pow",
			"dataType": "String",
			"dataTypeId": "i=12"
		},
		{
			"name": "Parameter",
			"description": "The parameter for operation",
			"dataType": "Double",
			"dataTypeId": "i=11"
		}
	],
	"outputArguments": [{
		"name": "Result",
		"description": "The result of 'operation(parameter)'",
		"dataType": "Double",
		"dataTypeId": "i=11"
	}]
}
```

#### Get method

This operation calls the method on the OPC UA server. It requires complete input arguments with an additional “value” fragment. 

```
{
	"deviceId": "<server-device-Id>",
	"c8y_ua_command_CallMethodOperation": {
		"request": {
			"nodeId": "ns=2;s=MyMethod",
			"arguments": [{
					"name": "Operation",
					"description": "The operation to perform on parameter: valid functions are sin, cos, tan, pow",
					"dataType": "String",
					"dataTypeId": "i=12",
					"value": "pow"
				},
				{
					"name": "Parameter",
					"description": "The parameter for operation",
					"dataType": "Double",
					"dataTypeId": "i=11",
					"value": "5"
				}
			]
		}
	},
	"description": "call method"
}
```

The result contains all output arguments with values set by the OPC UA server. 
Power of 5 is 25: 

```
{
	"statusCode": 0,
	"result": [{
		"name": "Result",
		"description": "The result of 'operation(parameter)'",
		"dataType": "Double",
		"dataTypeId": "i=11",
		"value": "25.0"
	}]
}
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Permission denied error when running the gateway JAR file on a Linux OS

![Permission denied](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-permission-denied-error.png)

If the following error appears,  add a baseDir property to the YAML file. For example:

```
db:
  baseDir: ${user.home}/.opcua/profile/data
```

#### Unknown host exception when running the gateway JAR

This error appears if the provided baseUrl property in the YAML file is incorrect. 

#### Failed to load property source from location when running the gateway JAR

The following error appears if the indentation of the properties in the YAML file is incorrect.

![Failed to load](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-failed-to-load.png)

#### java.net.BindException: Address already in use

![Address in use](/images/users-guide/opcua/opcua-address-in-use.png)

If this error appears, a Java process is running in the background. To fix this issue, the process must be stopped/killed.
