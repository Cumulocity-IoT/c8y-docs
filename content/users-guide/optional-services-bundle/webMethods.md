>**Info**: Support for the Cumulocity [Zapier integration](/guides/saas-integration) is discontinued and no new subscriptions are possible. Functionality for existing customers is not affected.


### Creating new integrations

To create a new integration, perform the following steps:

1. Log into your Cumulocity tenant as part of Software AG Cloud. 
2. If you are not subscribed to webMethods.io Integration, subscribe to it as follows:
	* 	Open the application switcher and select **MyCloud**.
	* 	Under **Other Software AG Cloud products**, click **Start trial** for webMethods.io Integration.
3. In the application switcher, select **webMethods.io Integration**.
1. Create an new integration using the predefined Cumulocity trigger. You must create a Cumulocity local user and use it as account in the trigger.
 

**Info**: Both products (webMethods.io Integration and Cumulocity IoT) are integrated into SAG Cloud. Therefore you can easily switch from Cumulocity IoT to webMethods.io and vice versa using the application switcher.
