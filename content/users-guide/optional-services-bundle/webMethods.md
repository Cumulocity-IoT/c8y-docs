webMethods.io Integration is Software AG's cloud based integration solution. It enables you to automate tasks by connecting cloud applications and services (such as Marketo, Salesforce, Evernote, and Gmail) without writing any code.

The complete webMethods.io Integration documentation is available at [https://docs.webmethods.io/](https://docs.webmethods.io/).

### Getting started

To subscribe to webMethods.io Integration, perform the following steps:

1. Log into your Cumulocity tenant as part of **Software AG Cloud**. 

    >**Info**: If your tenant has been created outside of SAG Cloud you will not benefit from the user experience described below. You can still use webMethods.io to integrate Cumulocity with other applications, but you cannot use the app switcher and single sign-on login.

2. If you are not subscribed to webMethods.io Integration, subscribe to it as follows:

	Open the application switcher and select **MyCloud**.
<br>![webMethods.io App Switcher My Cloud](/guides/images/users-guide/webMethods.io/wmio-appswitcher-mycloud.png)Under **Other Software AG Cloud products**, click **Start trial** for webMethods.io Integration. 

3. In the application switcher, select **webMethods.io Integration**.

>**Info**: Both products (webMethods.io Integration and Cumulocity IoT) are integrated into SAG Cloud. Therefore you can easily switch from Cumulocity IoT to webMethods.io and vice versa using the application switcher.  

### Examples

Integrations in webmethods.io are called "workflows". A workflow is a connection between two or more web apps or services. Itâ€™s like a set of steps required to perform a task.

The example workflow below is triggered by an alarm in Cumulocity and creates a ticket in Zendesk and sends an SMS message.

WebMethods.io also provides pre-configured workflows which are called "recipes".
