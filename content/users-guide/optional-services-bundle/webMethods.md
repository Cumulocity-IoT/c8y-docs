webMethods.io Integration is Software AG's cloud based integration solution. It enables you to automate tasks by connecting apps and services (such as Marketo, Salesforce, Evernote, and Gmail) without writing any code.

The complete webMethods.io Integration documentation is available at [https://docs.webmethods.io/](https://docs.webmethods.io/).

>**Info**: Support for the Cumulocity [Zapier integration](/guides/saas-integration) is discontinued and no new subscriptions are possible. Functionality for existing customers is not affected.

### Getting started

To subscribe to webMethods.io Integration, perform the following steps:

1. Log into your Cumulocity tenant as part of Software AG Cloud. 
2. If you are not subscribed to webMethods.io Integration, subscribe to it as follows:
	* 	Open the application switcher and select **MyCloud**.
	* 	Under **Other Software AG Cloud products**, click **Start trial** for webMethods.io Integration.
3. In the application switcher, select **webMethods.io Integration**.

>**Info**: Both products (webMethods.io Integration and Cumulocity IoT) are integrated into SAG Cloud. Therefore you can easily switch from Cumulocity IoT to webMethods.io and vice versa using the application switcher.  

### Creating new integration

Integrations in webmethods.io are called **Workflows**. A workflow is a connection between two or more web apps or services. Itâ€™s like a set of steps required to perform a task.

Pre-configured workflows are called **Recipes**. The Recipes section contains several pre-configured Cumulocity workflows that you can readily use. 

To create a new workflow, perform the following steps:

1. In Cumulocity select webMethods.io Integration from the Cumulocity app switcher.

2. Create a new integration using the predefined Cumulocity trigger. You must create a Cumulocity local user and use it as account in the trigger.
