webMethods.io Integration is Software AG's cloud based integration solution. It enables you to automate tasks by connecting apps and services (such as Marketo, Salesforce, Evernote, and Gmail) without writing any code.

The complete webMethods.io Integration documentation is available at [https://docs.webmethods.io/](https://docs.webmethods.io/).

>**Info**: Support for the Cumulocity [Zapier integration](/guides/saas-integration) is discontinued and no new subscriptions are possible. Functionality for existing customers is not affected.

### Examples

Integrations in webmethods.io are called **Workflows**. A workflow is a connection between two or more web apps or services. Itâ€™s like a set of steps required to perform a task.

The example workflow below is triggered by an alarm in Cumulocity and creates a ticket in Zendesk and sends and SMS message.
