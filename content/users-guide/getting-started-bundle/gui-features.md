### <a name="screen"></a>Main screen elements

The general structure common to all Cumulocity IoT applications includes the following screen elements:

![Cumulocity IoT application](/images/users-guide/getting-started/getting-started-screen-elements.png)

<table>
<col width="150">
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Element</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Navigator</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:left">On the left you find the navigator. At the top of the navigator the name and logo of the application is displayed, indicating which application you are currently using. Below you find a list of entries leading to the various pages of the application. The entries are grouped into menus and menu items. You can collapse or expand menus in the navigator by clicking the menu name. Clicking the small arrow at the very left of the top bar will hide/or unhide the navigator. Per default, it is visible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Page</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:left">"Page" actually refer to the main area in the application. The content provided here depends on the menu item selected in the dashboard. The structuring of the content differs from page to page. Data may for example be displayed in a list with a row for each object or you may find it being presented in a grid in which objects are represented by cards. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Tabs</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Some pages, e.g. the page of any particular device, are divided into several tabs, either displayed vertically or horizontally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Top bar</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Page title</strong><br> At the left of the top bar the title of the active page is displayed, if any. <br> <br><img src="/images/icons/search-icon.png" alt="Search" style="max-width:100%"> <strong>Search button</strong><br> Clicking the <strong>Search</strong> button opens a search field to enter text for a full-text search. For details, see <a href="#searching" class="no-ajaxy">Searching</a> below. Not always available.<br><br> <img src="/images/icons/plus-icon.png" alt="Plus" style="max-width:100%"> <strong>Plus button</strong><br> Most application pages show an <strong>Plus</strong> button at the top bar. Clicking it opens a context menu providing further functionalities. The context menu is created dynamically, i.e. it depends on the active page which commands are provided. <br><br><img src="/images/icons/switcher-icon.png" alt="User" style="max-width:100%"> <strong>Application Switcher button</strong><br> Clicking the <strong>Application Switcher</strong> button opens the <a href="#app-switcher" class="no-ajaxy">application switcher</a> which allows you to quickly switch between applications. <br><br> <img src="/images/icons/user-icon.png" alt="User" style="max-width:100%"> <strong>User button</strong><br> Right from the Application Switcher button you will find the <strong>User</strong> button with your user name. Clicking it will open up a context menu with commands related to your account settings. <br> <br>Other buttons/ information may be available in the top bar depending on the application and the page being displayed. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Top menu bar</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Depending on the active application and the active page, a secondary bar is displayed below the top bar providing further functionalities like a <strong>Reload</strong> link for reloading the page or a <strong>Realtime</strong> link for the display of realtime data. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Right drawer</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Clicking the small arrow at the very right of the top bar will unhide/hide the right drawer, offering quick links to other applications and to relevant documentation. Per default, the right drawer is hidden.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

On smaller screens, the layout is slightly different. The navigator is hidden and can be accessed by clicking the arrow icon on the top left. Only the active tab is displayed. To switch tabs, click the arrow on the tab header and select a tab from the list.

> **Info:** Cumulocity IoT applications provide tooltips when you hover over a particular screen element. When you use Cumulocity IoT applications on touch devices, tooltips are shown when you touch a screen element for a longer time.

### <a name="app-switcher"></a>Application switcher

The application switcher allows you to quickly switch between applications. Click the **Application Switcher** button at the right of the top bar to display a list of icons representing applications.

<img src="/images/users-guide/getting-started/getting-started-application-switcher.png" alt="Application switcher" style="max-width: 100%">

The application switcher shows all Cumulocity IoT applications you currently have access to. These can be subscribed applications, either built-in or custom ones, and [own applications](/users-guide/administration#own-applications). Just click the icon for the desired application to open it as active application.

If you are using SAG Cloud, the application switcher also shows other SAG Cloud applications at the first level, followed by the Cumulocity IoT applications:

### <a name="searching-and-filtering"></a>Search and filter functionality

#### <a name="searching"></a>Full text search

The Cumulocity IoT search field at the right of the top bar in the UI provides a full-text search.

![Search field](/images/users-guide/getting-started/getting-started-search-button.png)

The search result includes groups, devices and child devices. On entering a search term into the textbox, Cumulocity IoT returns all devices containing this term in any property (name, model, any fragment).

The search functionality is based on the [MongoDB full text search](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/text-search/).

Entering multiple words separated by a blank returns all objects that match any of the words. For example, entering

```text
My Demo Device
```

will return objects containing "My", "Demo" or "Device".

If you want to search for objects matching an exact phrase enclose it in quotation marks:

```text
"My Demo Device"
```

You can also exclude words by putting a hyphen before the word to search the inventory for objects containing e.g. "My" or "Demo" but not "Device":

```text
My Demo -Device
```

Case is ignored. The following search texts return the same result:

```text
My Demo Device
my demo device
```

**Info:** Other than with filtering, using wildcards in a search is not supported.

For details on the MongoDB full text search, see [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/text-search/](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/text-search/).

#### <a name="filtering"></a>Filtering

Some pages offer a filtering functionality to filter objects in a list.

![Filter field](/images/users-guide/getting-started/getting-started-filtering.png)

As opposed to the search functionality, on entering filtering criteria you must not necessarily enter complete words.

In many cases you can just enter any arbitrary text into the text field, even just 2-3 characters. Entering

```text
cl
```

will reduce the list to all objects containing the string "cl".

In other cases you may enter * as wildcard character to return all objects starting with "cl":

```text
cl*
```

The list will immediately be reduced to the selected objects.

>**Important:** On certain pages, the filter mechanism only searches through items shown on a page. This means that if an item is not listed on the respective page, it will not appear in the results. You need to load all results first to search through all items. This behavior applies to the following pages:

>* Device protocols 
* Firmware repository
* Software repository
* Configuration repository
* Tenants
* File repository

For details on the filtering mechanism in the devices list refer to [Device Management > Viewing devices > To filter devices](/users-guide/device-management#filtering-devices).

### Real-time behavior of the navigator

In the navigator, changes are not updated in real time, i.e. new, removed or renamed devices or groups will not be updated immediately.

You will only see such changes in the navigator of the application, in which you have made the changes. For example, if you unassign a device from a group in the Device Management application you will immediately see it removed from the group in the navigator of your current application, but if you have another window open with e.g. the Cockpit application you won't see the changes.

You will only see the changes after a refresh or another request (expanding a group in the navigator for example).
