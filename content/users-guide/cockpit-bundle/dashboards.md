Dashboards provide you with a customized visualization of your data by using a set of widgets. Widgets can display maps, images, graphs, tables and other graphic representations of data.

Cumulocity IoT comes with a number of preset widgets, see [Widgets collection](#widgets) for details. You can also develop your own widgets and add them to your Cumulocity IoT account. Refer to the [Web SDK guide](/web/) for details.

### <a name="creating-dashboards"></a>To create a dashboard

Select the group or the device in the navigator for which to create a dashboard.

Click the **Plus** button in the top bar and from the context menu select **Add dashboard**.

The dashboard editor opens.

In the **Tab** section of the dashboard editor, provide the following information:

*  An icon which is shown next to the dashboard name in the navigator.
*  A menu label to be used as the name of the dashboard.
* The location of the dashboard in the navigator, with "10000" being ordered first and "-10000" last

If you enable **Apply dashboard to all devices of type <device type>** the dashboard will be shared with all devices of this type.

In the **Layout** section you can select a theme for the dashboard (one of "Light", "Dark", "Transparent" or "Branded") and a default header style for the widgets (one of "Regular", "Border", "Overlay", or "Hidden"). Moreover, you can change the default widget margin (default value is 15 px).

If you enable the option **Translate widget titles if possible**, the widget title will be translated every time the language is changed.

> **Info:** The widget titles will be translated only if a valid translation is available.

In the **Preview** section at the right, a preview of the selected layout settings is immediately displayed to visualize your selections.

Click **Save** to create and open the dashboard.

Since there will be no widgets on the dashboard yet, you will see an **Add Widget** button instead.

### Modifying widgets on a dashboard

Widgets may be rearranged on the dashboard. By dragging and dropping you can move the widget to another position.

By dragging the arrows on the bottom right corner of a widget, you can resize it.

To edit the properties of a widget on a dashboard, click the cogwheel icon at the top right corner of the widget and from the context menu select **Edit**.

To delete a widget from a dashboard, click the cogwheel icon at the top right corner of the widget and from the context menu select **Remove**.

Widgets can only be modified, if the dashboard is unlocked. To lock/unlock a dashboard, use the toggle with the lock icon in the top menu bar.

>**Info:** On touch devices like smartphones or tablets some functions may not be supported.


### <a name="sharing-dashboards"></a>Sharing dashboards

You can create a dashboard for a specific device and share it with all devices of the same type. This is only possible though, if the type property is set for the device.

To do so, select the option **Apply dashboard to all devices of type [TYPE]** ([TYPE] is replaced with the type of the device that is currently selected).

A corresponding message will be displayed in the editor.

<img src="/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-dashboard-share.png" name="Shared dashboard"/>

Changes made to this dashboard are automatically applied to all dashboard instances.

> **Info:** You can only add widgets and data to the dashboard for the device itself. It is not possible to add data from child devices because the structure of these devices might be different from device to device.


### To edit a dashboard

To edit a dashboard, click **Edit** in the top menu bar.

<img src="/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-dashboard-edit.png" name="Edit dashboard"/>

The dashboard editor will open up. For details on the fields, refer to [To create a dashboard](#creating-dashboards).


### To copy a dashboard from one object to another

1. Click **More...** in the top menu bar and from the context menu select **Copy dashboard**.

	<img src="/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-dashboard-copy.png" name="Copy dashboard"/>

2. Next, navigate to the object you want to copy the dashboard to and from the context menu select **Paste dashboard [NAME]** to insert the dashboard.

An alternative way to copy a dashboard is to use the
"dashboard per type" approach.  With the "dashboard per type" approach you share the dashboard from one object with **all** objects of the same type, see [Sharing dashboards](#sharing-dashboards).


### To delete a dashboard

To delete a dashboard from an object, click **More...** in the top menu bar and from the context menu select **Delete dashboard**.
