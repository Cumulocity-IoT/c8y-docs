#### opcua-device-gateway downgrades from 10.12.0

Due to security improvements, opcua-device-gateway downgrades from 10.12.0 to previous versions will not be directly supported. Downgrading to a previous version is still possible by following the downgrade instructions as described in the OPC UA protocol integration documentation for release 10.12.0.
