<td>
MTM-41004</td>

<tr>
<td>
Connectivity</td>
<td> The check if a mobile device is managed by the currently configured SIM provider is now only done on opening the <b>Connectivity</b> tab of a device. This puts eventual errors in a logical context and reduces the number of checks.</td>
<td>

<tr>
<td>
Email templates</td>
<td> When the tenant administrator creates a new user, the user receives a confirmation email along with a password reset option. Previously, the default password reset email template did not contain the username. The template has been changed so that for new users the username is included in the email.</td>
<td>

</tr>



<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td> When green password is enforced and the minimal strong password length ('system.password.green.min-length' property) is higher than the device password length ('device-user.password.length' property), the system will use the green.min-length value, i.e. generate a longer password. Prior to this change, the system rejected auto-generated passwords that were too short blocking device bootstrap.</td>
