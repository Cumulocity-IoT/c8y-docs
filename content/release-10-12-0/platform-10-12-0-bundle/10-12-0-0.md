<td>
Administration</td>
<td> The <b>New tenant</b> window had some overlapping style issues on the <b>Storage limit per device</b> field resulting in unreadable error messages. These issues have been fixed.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Connectivity</td>
<td> The check if a mobile device is managed by the currently configured SIM provider is now only done on opening the <b>Connectivity</b> tab of a device. This puts eventual errors in a logical context and reduces the number of checks.</td>
<td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td> When green password is enforced and the minimal strong password length ('system.password.green.min-length' property) is higher than the device password length ('device-user.password.length' property), the system will use the green.min-length value, i.e. generate a longer password. Prior to this change, the system rejected auto-generated passwords that were too short blocking device bootstrap.</td>

<td> Removed default names related to Cumulocity IoT or Software AG in the SMS provider configuration.</td>
<td>
