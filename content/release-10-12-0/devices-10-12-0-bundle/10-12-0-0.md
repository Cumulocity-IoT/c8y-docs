Bulk Operations</td>
<td> With the introduction of the new bulk operations functionality (see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/device-management/#to-view-bulk-operations" class="no-ajaxy"<Device Management > Monitoring and controlling devices</a> in the <i>User guide</i>) the <b>Bulk operations</b> tab in the groups view became obsolete and has been removed. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Monitoring</td>
<td> A new log file related to devices availability monitoring has been created. The log file is by default disabled. The purpose of the log file is to trace communication between the device and the Cumulocity IoT platform. The log file contains information needed to determine if the logged request exchanged between a device and the Cumulocity IoT platform should influence the device availability state or not. The log file contains the following information: date, tenant ID, device ID, processing mode, user name, information if the request originates from a device or application.
To active logging entries, the tenant option with category devices-availability and key debug-enabled-for should be set in the scope of the Management tenant. The value of the options is a comma-separated list that contains tenant ID and device ID. The device ID is optional. When the device ID is not present then requests related to each device of the certain tenant are stored in a log file. An example value is management/,tenant1/00001,tenant1/00002. Take into consideration that logging a large number of requests may cause a serious performance drop so that the log should be enabled only when it is required for the smallest possible group of devices.
Setting tenant option with category devices-availability and key debug-enabled-for is necessary but not a sufficient condition for the Cumulocity IoT platform to append information about requests to the log file. The log file must also be enabled on platform operation level. </td>

<td>
Tracker agent </td>
<td> The Tracker agent is now a fully functional microservice. It now needs to be subscribed to be used in a tenant. Tenants that have previously been registered are now also subscribed to the new microservice. </td>

LWM2M</td>
<td> The attribute <code>C8Y.lwm2m.enableBootstrapPSKFragmentFallback</code> has been added to the agent's default configuration. If enabled, the LWM2M agent will find the bootstrap PSK ID from the fragments if it cannot be found from the external IDs.</td>

OPC UA</td>
<td> The processing mode set in the OPC UA device protocol is now also applied to the mappings created due to historic read operations with tag type TAG.</td>

<tr>
<td>
OP CUA</td>
<td> To achieve higher security, the private key used in the gateway for application identity is now AESCGM-encrypted. As a result, running previous versions of the opcua-device-gateway is no longer supported.</td>
