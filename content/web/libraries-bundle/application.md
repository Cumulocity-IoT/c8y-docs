The application package (`@c8y/apps`) provides example applications for the Web SDK.

### Prerequisites

To use the @c8y/apps you need to install the [@c8y/cli](/web/development-tools/#c8y-cli). Refer to its documentation for installation instructions.

Once installed you can run:

```
$ c8ycli new [your-app-name] [example-name]
```

For example, to generate the tutorial application with the name `my-app` you need to run:

```
$ c8ycli new my-app tutorial
```
