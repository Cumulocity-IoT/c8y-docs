The [Web SDK for plugins](/guides/web/web-sdk-for-plugins) is deprecated. To develop new web applications we recommend using [Web SDK for Angular](/guides/web/angular). If you already developed a plugin, read the [migration guide](/guides/web/angular#migrating) on how you can import plugins into the Web SDK for Angular.
