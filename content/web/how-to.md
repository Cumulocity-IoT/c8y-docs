This section lists common how to recipes for the [Web SDK for Angular](/guides/web/angular). They have the following preconditions:
 
 - a basic understanding of Angular components, services and modules
 - understanding on how to scaffold an application and how to run it with the [@c8y/cli](/guides/web/angular/#cli)
 - basic understanding of the extension points concepts of the [@c8y/ngx-components](/guides/web/angular/#extension-points)

 > **Note:** The recipes are written with a certain version of the Web SDK for Angular. The version is mentioned at the beginning of the recipe. It is not recommended to use an older version for remixing this recipe, as some of the mentioned features might not be available. If you using a newer version there might naming or import changes. We will update the recipes if there are conceptual revisions but not for small variations. Please check out the tutorial application with `c8ycli new my-app tutorial` to have an up to date example of all concepts.
