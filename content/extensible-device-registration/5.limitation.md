### Extensible Device Registration limitations

-   The concept does not allow the microservice to hook into deregistrations/decommissioning of a device: 
    - Any device integration microservice has to check if a device was deleted, for example to perform garbage collection.
- Interactive steps (like “Bluetooth Coupling”) can not be implemented as of now: The reason here is that the concept assumes only static properties are required for a device registration, not a sort of process that requires user interactions
    - In theory, the meta-data based approach can easily be extended in a way that the JSON used to render the form is not static, but dynamically generated by the microservice. For example, you could specify a “page” that draws the next specification dynamically from an endpoint after posting all given user inputs there
    - We step back from such a solution from now, because it complicates the data model and the requirements to be fulfilled by the microservice.
- No custom validations in the UI besides input validations by the JSON Schema vocabulary
- No custom styling possible
