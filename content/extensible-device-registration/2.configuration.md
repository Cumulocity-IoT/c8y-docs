The key idea is that the microservice which implements an arbitrary device integration can provide this metadata to the UI via a REST endpoint. The UI can then use this meta data to generate new wizards on the fly.

The big benefit of this strategy over the other strategies is that it does not require a device integration developer to write UI code at all. Hence, this dramatically simplifies adding new device technologies to the platform in contrast to the other approaches.

It is important to know that the registration of a device can be typically generalized as the provisioning of a flat list of registration attributes

First step in order to extend Device Registration flow is to define extension. There are two types of extensions:
 - single device registrations type: `extensibleDeviceRegistration`, e.g.:
 

```json
{
  "name": "<extension name>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "type": "extensibleDeviceRegistration"
}
```
- bulk device registration type: `extensibleBulkDeviceRegistration`, e.g.:
```json
{
  "name": "<extension name>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "type": "extensibleBulkDeviceRegistration"
}
```

> **Note** Above fragments can be placed inside the manifest fragment for kubernetes installations or at root level fragment for standalone installations.
