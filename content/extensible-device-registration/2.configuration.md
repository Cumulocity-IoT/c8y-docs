First step in order to extend Device Registration flow is to define extension in the application representation.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
Below `extensions` fragment can be placed either as root level or inside `manifest` fragment of the application representation.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

There are two types of extensions:
 - Single device registrations type: `extensibleDeviceRegistration`, e.g.:

```json
"extensions": [
  {
    "name": "<extension name>",
    "description": "<description>",
    "type": "extensibleDeviceRegistration"
  },
  ...
]
```
- Bulk device registration type: `extensibleBulkDeviceRegistration`, e.g.:
```json
"extensions": [
  {
    "name": "<extension name>",
    "description": "<description>",
    "type": "extensibleBulkDeviceRegistration"
  },
  ...
]
```
