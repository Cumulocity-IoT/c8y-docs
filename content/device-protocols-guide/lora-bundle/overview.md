Cumulocity IoT can interface with LoRa devices through Actility's ThingPark Wireless. You can:

* Provision and deprovision LoRa devices easily using the Cumulocity IoT Device Management. No interaction in the ThingPark user interface is required.
* Decode upstream payload packets using a web-based user interface.
* Debug and postprocess raw device data through Cumulocity IoT events.
* Send downstream data to the device using Cumulocity IoT operations.
* Make use of existing Cumulocity IoT features with LoRa devices, for example: connectivity monitoring, device management, data visualization with dashboards, real-time analytics and more.

The following illustration gives an overview of the Cumulocity IoT LoRa Actility integration.
