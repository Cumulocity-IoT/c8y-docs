To manage device protocols more conveniently, you can export them to a file. The file can be re-imported to  set up other Cumulocity IoT accounts easily or to restore the protocols from a backup. The import functionality also supports importing ready-made device protocols provided by device manufacturers.

To export a device protocol, click the menu icon at the right of the respective  row and click **Export**.

A file with the device protocol definition will be downloaded, named "&lt;device type&gt;.json".
