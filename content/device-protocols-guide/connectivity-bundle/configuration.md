Process the following step to configure the connectivity in Cumulocity IoT:

1. Use a Cumulocity IoT administrator user to log into the Cumulocity IoT platform.
1. Switch to the Administration application.
1. Click **Connectivity** in the **Settings** menu of the navigator. If the menu item is not displayed, make sure that your user has [ADMIN permission for Connectivity](/users-guide/administration#managing-permissions). If the menu item is still not available, please [contact support](/about-doc/contacting-support) to make the Connectivity agent available in your tenant.
2. Switch to the **SIM provider settings** tab.
3. Select a provider from the drop-down list.
1. Enter the credentials (URL, key (in case of Jasper), username and password) for the respective SIM provider account. If you do not have any credentials, ask your administrator.
2. Click **Save** to save your settings.
