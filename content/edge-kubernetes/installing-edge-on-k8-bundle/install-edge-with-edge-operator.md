This method is suitable for users who already have a Kubernetes cluster and want to install Edge using existing Kubernetes tools. Before you start the installation, ensure that you have met the [prerequisites](/edge-kubernetes/installing-edge-on-k8/#prerequisites).

You will need Helm version 3.x available on your system. Refer to [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for the installation instructions.

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
**Edge on a self-managed Kubernetes cluster is tested and supported on single-node Kubernetes clusters only, running Kubernetes version 1.32.x.** Multi-node clusters and other Kubernetes versions are not supported by this release. We aim to support CNCF-certified Kubernetes distributions provided they use upstream Kubernetes version 1.32.x and meet the documented resource and environment prerequisites, and will validate newer Kubernetes versions in future maintenance releases.
{{< /c8y-admon-important >}}

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
Your Kubernetes cluster must also meet the following requirements:

* Support for **LoadBalancer services**.
* No **Ingress provider** (for example, Traefik) enabled on common ports that would block those used by Edge, such as ports 80 and 443.
* **Dynamic volume provisioning** enabled with a default storage class.

### Installing the Edge operator {#installing-edge-operator}
The Edge operator is available as a Helm chart in the Edge registry, and can be installed like any other chart. You will need your registry credentials, which can be acquired from [product support](/additional-resources/contacting-support/). Assuming you are installing the {{< c8y-edge-current-version >}} release of Edge, and that you wish all Edge workloads to be running in the namespace `c8yedge`, run the following command:
```shell
helm registry login registry.c8y.io --username="<Edge registry username>" --password="<Edge registry password>"

helm upgrade --install c8yedge-operator oci://registry.c8y.io/edge/helm-charts/cumulocity-iot-edge-operator \
    --version={{< c8y-edge-current-version >}} \
    --namespace c8yedge \
    --create-namespace \
    --set imageCredentials.username="<Edge registry username>" \
    --set imageCredentials.password="<Edge registry password>" \
    --wait
```

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
If you are installing Edge on an environment that has no or limited internet access, we strongly recommend using the **c8yedge** tool for installing and upgrading Edge.

If you have to use existing Kubernetes infrastructure, then using the c8yedge tool will not be possible and you will have to provide a private registry and configure Edge to use it. See [Configuring Edge to use a private registry](/edge-kubernetes/configuring-private-registry/). After following those steps, you will need to modify the above command to use this new private registry.

* Change `oci://registry.c8y.io/...` in the above command line to `oci://<registry-hostname>:<registry-port>/...`
* Use whatever user name and password you have configured for the private registry, not the Edge registry credentials.
* Provide an additional argument `--set imageCredentials.registry=<registry-hostname>:<registry-port>`
* Provide an additional argument `--set image.repository=<registry-hostname>:<registry-port>/edge/helm-charts/cumulocity-iot-edge-operator`
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

Run the following command to follow the logs for the Edge operator pod:
```shell
kubectl logs -f -n c8yedge deployment/c8yedge-operator-controller-manager manager
```

### Installing Edge
Download and edit the Edge CR ([c8yedge.yaml](/files/edge-k8s/c8yedge.yaml)), before applying it to your Kubernetes cluster by running the command below:

```bash
kubectl apply -f c8yedge.yaml
```
This command will complete immediately, and the installation will proceed in the background. See [Monitoring changes](/edge-kubernetes/manage-edge/#monitoring-changes) to track the progress of the installation.

For more information about the structure and configuration options available in the Edge CR, see [Edge custom resource](/edge-kubernetes/edge-custom-resource-definition/).

### Configuring proxy

When {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge is deployed behind a proxy, it must be configured to communicate with external endpoints over the internet through the proxy server.
To configure Edge to use a proxy, you must create or update a ConfigMap named `custom-environment-variables` in the c8yedge namespace (or the one you deployed Edge into) with the required proxy settings. The keys `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `socks_proxy` must be set to the URLs of the HTTP, HTTPS and Socks proxies, respectively. The key `no_proxy` must be set to specify a comma-separated list of domain suffixes, IP addresses, or CIDR ranges that Edge should bypass the proxy server for.

Here is an example of a ConfigMap with proxy settings:

```yaml
##
## An optional ConfigMap to configure the Edge operator with
##    - Proxy details when accessing external endpoints through a Proxy
##    - TLS/SSL certificates to trust
##
## http_proxy, https_proxy and optionally socks_proxy must be configured with the relevant URLs.
## no_proxy must be configured with a comma-separated list of addresses or domains for which the proxy should be bypassed.
##

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  ## The name is fixed and cannot be changed.
  name: custom-environment-variables
  ## Namespace name into which you installed the Edge operator.
  namespace: c8yedge
data:
  http_proxy: <HTTP Proxy URL>
  https_proxy: <HTTPS Proxy URL>
  socks_proxy: <SOCKS Proxy URL>

  ## A comma-separated list of addresses or domains for which the proxy will be bypassed.
  ## This must be configured with the specified entries, Edge domain name, Kubernetes Pod CIDR (Cluster Pod IP Address Range), 
  ## Kubernetes Service CIDR (Cluster Service IP Address Range) and any other domains, hosts or IPs 
  ## you want to bypass the proxy when accessed.
  no_proxy: 127.0.0.1,::1,localhost,.svc,.cluster.local,cumulocity,<edge domain name, for example, myown.iot.com>,<kubernetes cluster IP range, for example, 10.43.0.0/16>

  ## TLS/SSL certificates in PEM format that the Edge operator can trust, in addition to those included in the default system trust store.
  ## You can provide multiple TLS/SSL certificates for trust by combining them into a single string.
  ca.crt: <CA-CERTIFICATES TO TRUST>
```

By configuring Edge with the appropriate proxy settings, you ensure that it can seamlessly communicate with external endpoints through the proxy server, allowing it to function effectively in environments where proxy usage is mandated.
