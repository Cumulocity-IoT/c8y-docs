With the Branding feature, you can fully customize the look of your tenant to your own preferences. To access the branding feature:

Log into the {{< management-tenant >}} using the management domain (for example, `management.myown.iot.com`) and administrator credentials created during the installation. For more information on logging in to the {{< management-tenant >}}, see [To access Edge](/edge-kubernetes/installing-edge-on-k8/#to-access-cumulocity-iot-edge)

Switch to the Administration application using the application switcher at the right of the top bar **<img class="Default" src="/images/icons/switcher-icon.png" alt="Application switcher" style="display: inline; float: none">**.

Go to **Settings** > **{{< enterprise-tenant >}}** and follow the instructions detailed in [Branding](enterprise-tenant/customization/#branding).
