**Symptom: Your event processing rules are disabled automatically**

Cumulocity IoT monitors the memory usage and workload generated by event processing rules, as well as any errors that are occurring while running those rules. If an event processing rule consumes too much memory or generates too many errors, Cumulocity IoT automatically disables this rule.

**Troubleshoot from having rules disabled due to memory consumption:**

Make sure that your event processing rules do not keep too many events in windows. For example, if you use "win:keepall()" and many events enter the rule, it will be disabled within a short time. Instead of using "win:keepall()", try using statements such as "std:lastevent()" that consumes less memory.

**Troubleshoot from getting disabled due to too high amount of errors:**

Monitor the amount of statements for errors. To see errors you will need to read through the details. In case of an error, correct the statement.
An example of a wrong statement: "insert into UpdateAlarm select "CLEARED" as status from...‚Äù is regarded as an error statement.
An example of a corrected statement is: "insert into UpdateAlarm select "10201" as ID, "CLEARED" as status from..."
