The real-time statements interface consists of five parts:

-   The *cep* API resource returns a URI to a module collection.
-   The *module collection* resource retrieves modules and enables creating new modules.
-   The *module* resource represents an individual module that can be queried, modified, deployed or undeployed.Â
