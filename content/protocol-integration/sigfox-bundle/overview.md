Cumulocity IoT can interface with Sigfox devices through the Sigfox Cloud. You can:

- Provision Sigfox devices easily using Cumulocity IoT Device Management.
- Decode upstream payload packets using a web-based user interface.
- Debug and post-process raw device data through Cumulocity IoT events.
- Send downstream data to the device using Cumulocity IoT operations.
- Make use of existing Cumulocity IoT features with Sigfox devices, for example: connectivity monitoring, device management, data visualization with dashboards, real-time analytics and more.

The following illustration grants you a quick overview of the Cumulocity IoT Sigfox integration:

The following sections describe how to:

- [Manage the connectivity settings](#connectivity-sigfox) in Cumulocity IoT.
- [Create device protocols](#device-protocols) with Cumulocity IoT's device database.
- [Register devices](#register-device-sigfox) and visualize the Sigfox payload using Cumulocity IoT.
- [Update devices](#old-registration) registered with the general device registration.
- [Send operations](#operations-sigfox) to devices.

Moreover, check out the [Troubleshooting](#sigfox-troubleshooting) section in case of any issues.
