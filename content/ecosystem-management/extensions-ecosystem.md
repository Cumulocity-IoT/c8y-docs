Click **Extensions** in the **Ecosystem** menu in the navigator to display all extensions in your account.

Extensions make it easier to share and reuse UI features across different applications. UI features can be developed as plugins and added to an application without coding knowledge. There are two types of extensions:

- Plugins
- Blueprints

Blueprint applications must be deployed, while plugins are added to other applications. This allows you to scaffold entire solutions or to extend existing ones. Due to the micro frontend technology, this can happen at runtime without rebuilding.

Switch to the **Plugins** tab of an application to view all plugins installed on an application.

In the **Plugins** tab you can add and remove plugins. Additionally, you can install plugins to an application.
