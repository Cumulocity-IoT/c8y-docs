This guide includes device integration tutorials for the following devices:

[Mbed u-blox](/device-integration/integration-tutorials/mbed-ublox), [Raspberry Pi ](/device-integration/integration-tutorials/raspberry-pi-4) and [Tinkerforge](/device-integration/integration-tutorials/tinkerforge) serve as simple demo devices that you can set up for proof-of-concept purposes in your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} environment. The tutorials show how you can register third-party devices with {{< product-c8y-iot >}} in just a few minutes, and then interact with the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform. Note that these demo devices should only be used for testing purposes.

The [Casa Systems (NetComm) router](/device-integration/integration-tutorials/netcomm-router) is a robust industrial IoT router designed for forwarding data packets between IoT devices within a network. The tutorial describes how to set up and configure a NetComm router using the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} NetComm Agent package.

For further information on supported devices refer to the [{{< product-c8y-iot >}} {{< device-portal >}}]({{< link-device-portal >}}), which offers an extensive collection of devices with guaranteed plug-and-play compatibility and full functional support in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform. You will find descriptions on how to configure and connect each device included there.
