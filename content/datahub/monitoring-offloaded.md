Once you have configured and started your offloading pipelines, they regularly offload data to the data lake. DataHub Console provides insights into the execution status of the different pipelines so that you can investigate whether everything is running as expected.

You can either examine the corresponding latest execution for all configured pipelines or examine the execution history for a specific pipeline.
