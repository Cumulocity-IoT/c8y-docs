If you have a Java client, you can use JDBC to run SQL queries against the data lake.  You have to download the [Dremio JDBC driver](https://www.dremio.com/drivers/). You can obtain the JDBC connection string from DataHub Console by clicking the **JDBC** icon in the **Quick links** section of the **Home** page. As username and password use the credentials from your Dremio account when setting up your JDBC client.

For additional JDBC settings of Dremio see also the associated [Dremio documentation](https://docs.dremio.com/drivers/dremio-jdbc-driver.html).
