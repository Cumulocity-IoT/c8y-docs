If you want to use an ODBC client to run SQL queries against the data lake, you have to configure the platform-specific driver, following the associated [Dremio installation instructions](https://docs.dremio.com/drivers/dremio-odbc-driver.html). To obtain the ODBC connection string, click the **ODBC** icon in the **Quick links** section of the **Home** page. As username and password use the credentials from your Dremio/DataHub Console account when setting up your ODBC client.
