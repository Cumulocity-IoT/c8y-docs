### Cumulocity IoT DataHub

Cumulocity IoT DataHub is now available in the Cumulocity IoT Cloud platform. With easy-to-use data pipelines you can extract data from Cumulocity IoTâ€™s Operational Store to a data lake for long-term archival and efficient analytical querying. With a SQL-based Query Interface you can query the data lake and connect arbitrary applications that either support ODBC, JDBC, or REST protocols.
