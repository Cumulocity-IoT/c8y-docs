Cumulocity IoT DataHub Release 10.6, April 2020, includes the following improvements, fixes and known issues:

### DataHub Edge

Cumulocity IoT DataHub is now also available as an addon to the Cumulocity IoT Edge, the local version of Cumulocity IoT. DataHub Edge offers the same capabilities as the cloud variant does, namely data pipelines for moving data from Cumulocity's Operational Store to a local data lake and a SQL query interface for querying that data in an efficient manner.

Learn more about DataHub Edge in section [Running DataHub on the Edge](/datahub/running-datahub-on-the-edge).
