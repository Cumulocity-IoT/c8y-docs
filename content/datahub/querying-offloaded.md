Cumulocity IoT DataHub offers an SQL interface so that you can efficiently query offloaded (device) data and leverage the results in your own applications. A prerequisite for running SQL queries over device data is that you have configured and executed offloading pipelines that replicate and transform data from Cumulocity's Operational Store to the data lake.
