Cumulocity IoT DataHub Release 10.5, November 2019, includes the following improvements and limitations:

### Cumulocity IoT DataHub

Cumulocity IoT DataHub is now available in the Cumulocity IoT Cloud platform. With easy-to-use data pipelines you can extract data from Cumulocity IoTâ€™s Operational Store to a data lake for long-term archival and efficient analytical querying. With a SQL-based Query Interface you can query the data lake and connect arbitrary applications that support either ODBC, JDBC, or REST protocols.

See section [Cumulocity IoT DataHub at a glance](/datahub/datahub-overview/#datahub-at-a-glance) to learn more about DataHub.

### Limitations

|:---
|If the collection to be offloaded has JSON attributes consisting of more than 32,000 characters, its data cannot be offloaded.|
|If the collection to be offloaded has more than 800 JSON attributes, its data cannot be offloaded.|
|If an attribute of a collection has varying types associated, the result table will contain a mixed type which may render query writing difficult or lead to problems with subsequent consumer applications.|
|DataHub requires a separate Kubernetes instance with version 1.9 or higher for running the Dremio cluster; it cannot run within the Kubernetes instance of the Cumulocity platform.|
