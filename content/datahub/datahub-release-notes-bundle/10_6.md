Cumulocity IoT DataHub Release 10.6, April 2020, includes the following improvements, limitations, and known issues:

### DataHub Edge

Cumulocity IoT DataHub is now also available as an add-on to the Cumulocity IoT Edge, the local version of Cumulocity IoT. DataHub Edge offers the same capabilities as the cloud variant, namely data pipelines for moving data from Cumulocity's Operational Store to a local data lake and an SQL query interface for querying that data in an efficient manner.

Learn more about DataHub Edge in section [Running DataHub on the Edge](/datahub/running-datahub-on-the-edge).

### Limitations

|<div style="width:250px">Description</div>
|:---
|If the collection to be offloaded has JSON attributes consisting of more than 32,000 characters, its data cannot be offloaded.|
|If the collection to be offloaded has more than 800 JSON attributes, its data cannot be offloaded.|
|If an attribute of a collection has varying types associated, the result table will contain a mixed type which may render query writing difficult or lead to problems with subsequent consumer applications.|
|DataHub requires a separate Kubernetes instance with version 1.9 or higher for running the Dremio cluster; it cannot run within the Kubernetes instance of the Cumulocity platform.|

### Known issues

|Edition|Description
|:---|:---
|Edge & cloud|If you define an offloading pipeline and insert an invalid additional filter predicate or additional column expression, the resulting error message can be hard to read.|
|Edge & cloud|If you do not have the required roles for DataHub and log in into DataHub UI, you will not get a notification for the missing roles. The menu bar on the left hand side of the UI is not shown. Thus, you cannot interact with the UI.|
|Edge|There are no retention policies in place that prevent the data lake contents from exceeding the hard disk limits.|
|Edge|TLS is not supported for ODBC and JDBC.|
