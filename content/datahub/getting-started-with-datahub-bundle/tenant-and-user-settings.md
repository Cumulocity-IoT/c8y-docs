The DataHub Console you have access to is tenant-specific, i.e., this instance solely serves your tenant. You use your Cumulocity account to access your DataHub Console instance. This instance is already pre-configured with respect to the connections to Dremio and to the data lake. These settings can only be changed by the administrator.

> **Info:** In addition to your Cumulocity account, you have a separate account for accessing Dremio. You have to contact your administrator for the Dremio account credentials. On the **Home** page you will find under **Quick links** a direct link to the Dremio instance you are using.
