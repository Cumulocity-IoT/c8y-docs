Cumulocity offers a feature preview program. By participating in Cumulocityâ€™s preview program, customers can proactively take part in the development process by testing, evaluating, and providing feedback for new features before they are generally available (GA).


#### Public Preview

Features available as Public Preview are listed in the change logs with a corresponding preview label: -Preview-

Features in Public Preview have undergone detailed testing. Functional changes, however, are both allowed and expected. Users must have no expectation of stability. There is no guarantee of backwards compatibility and that the feature will become part of the product.

The documentation of features in Public Preview is included in this public documentation. The respective sections are marked accordingly:

{{< c8y-admon-preview >}}
This is a preview feature.
{{< /c8y-admon-preview >}}


### General availability

Features that are generally available are listed in the change logs with a corresponding feature label: -Feature-
