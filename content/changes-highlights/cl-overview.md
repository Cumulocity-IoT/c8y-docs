Cumulocity offers a feature preview program. By participating in Cumulocityâ€™s preview program, customers can proactively take part in the development process by testing, evaluating, and providing feedback for new features before they are generally available (GA).

#### Private Preview

A selected number of customers will be invited to participate in an early access of features which are currently under development. The activation of this features is taken care of by the Cumulocity Operations team.

The feature has been tested in development. Functional changes, however, are both allowed and expected. Users must have no expectation of stability. There is no guarantee of backwards compatibility and that the feature will become part of the product.

The documentation of features in Private Preview mode is not publicly available.

#### Public Preview

Features available as public preview are listed in the change logs with a corresponding preview label: -Preview-

Customers can opt-in to these features by registering. Features in Public Preview mode have undergone additional testing. Yet, the same restrictions as for Private Preview features apply.  

The documentation of features in Private Preview mode is included in this public documentation. The respective sections are marked accordingly.
