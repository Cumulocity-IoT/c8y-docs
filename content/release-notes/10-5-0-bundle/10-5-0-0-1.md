### Documentation

#### Device SDK for Java

The *Device SDK for Java* documentation has been moved from the [Device SDK guide](/guides/device-sdk/introduction/) to the Java Device SDK sources in Bitbucket at [https://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-clients-java/src/develop/]( https://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-clients-java/src/develop/).

#### Device SDK for C#

The *Device SDK for C#* documentation has been moved from the [Device SDK guide](/guides/device-sdk/introduction/) to the C# Device SDK sources in Bitbucket at h[ttps://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-clients-cs/src/develop/DeviceSDK/Documentation/](https://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-clients-cs/src/develop/DeviceSDK/Documentation/). 

#### About section

A new [About](/guides/about/overview/) section has been added to the documentation, showing information on documentation versions, content, conventions and copyrights.

#### New device catalogue

A new [Cumulocity IoT Device Partner Portal](https://devicepartnerportal.softwareag.com/dcp-publicweb/#/) has been implemented, offering an extensive [collection](https://devicepartnerportal.softwareag.com/dcp-publicweb/#/devices) of devices with guaranteed plug-and-play compatibility and full functional support in the Cumulocity IoT platform. Apart from general information on each device you can find quick start guides here, describing how to configure the particular device and connect it to the Cumulocity IoT platform. The information formerly provided in the Device guides on the [Cumulocity documentation website](https://www.softwareag.cloud/site/dev-center/cumulocity-iot.html#/) has been moved to the Partner Portal. The former Device guides are no longer available. 

Description of the following devices has been removed as these are no longer supported: Beagle Bone Black, Cinterion Java modules, Mbed u-blox C027, Raspberry Pi, Robustel, Tinkerforge. 

##### OPCUA agent 1.0

The documentation of the OPCUA agent has been moved to the source code in Bitbucket at


### Migration

#### Deprecation of DELETE method for audit logs

Cumulocity IoT offers a rich audit logging functionality to keep track of ongoing activities for the investigation of security-relevant events. In the past, we allowed deletion of these audit log entries by administrators. This method has been deprecated and will be removed completely with the July 2020 release (10.6.6). With Cumulocity IoT >= 10.6.6 the deletion of audit logs will no longer be permitted. All DELETE requests to the audit API will return the error "405 Method not allowed".  

Note that retention rules still apply to audit logs and will delete audit log records older than the specified retention time, see also [Auditing > Audit record collection](/guides/reference/auditing/#audit-record-collection
) in the Reference guide.
