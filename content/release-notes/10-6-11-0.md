<tr>
<td>
Smart rules</td>
<td > Java SDK: To optimize query performance, support for the inventory API query parameter without children has been added. The parameter now allows to execute queries to get a list or single managed objects faster by omitting the children list. Moreover, the amount of data returned by the endpoint is reduced. This is highly useful when querying a device group with a large set of child devices.<br>
Smart rule: Increased performance when getting the smart rules defined for a large group of devices. </td>
