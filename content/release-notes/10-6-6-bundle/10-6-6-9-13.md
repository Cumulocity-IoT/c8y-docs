<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td > The LWM2M device client awake time can now be defined in the device managed object if the device does not send it during registration. Preference is given to the client awake time (awaketimeRegistrationParameter) defined in the device managed object. </td>
<td>
MTM-34152</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td > A new parameter,  C8Y.lwm2mMaxRequestTimeout, has been introduced to allow the request timeout to be set at the individual device.  The default value is 10 minutes. The lwm2mRequestTimeout specified at the device managed object and the global C8Y.lwm2mRequestTimeout should always be  less than the C8Y.lwm2mMaxRequestTimeout value. The order in which these timeouts are used is: first lwm2mRequestTimeout and if that is not defined then the global lwm2mRequestTimeout value is used. </td>
