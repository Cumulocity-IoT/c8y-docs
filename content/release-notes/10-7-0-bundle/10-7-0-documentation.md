### Device SDK guide - NEW Linux agent documentation

Documentation has been added to the *Device SDK guide* for the Cumulocity IoT Linux Agent.

The [Linux Agent developer guide](/device-sdk/linux-agent-developer-guide) contains various Lua plugin examples (Hello world, sending measurements, restart your machine, and more) for developers. 

### NEW Device protocols guide

The documentation for various device integration protocols has been moved into a separate file to provide a clearer structure and easier navigation.

### Cloud Remote Access - NEW API documentation

Information on the Cloud Remote Access API has been added to the Cloud Remote Access documentation. 

As a result, the Cloud Remote Access documentation, which formerly could be found in the *Optional services* section of the *User guide*, has been moved into a separate [Cloud Remote Access guide](/cloud-remote-access/cra-general-aspects/), providing a clearer structure and easier navigation.
