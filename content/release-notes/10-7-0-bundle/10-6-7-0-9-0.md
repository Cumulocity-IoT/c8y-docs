<td>
C# SDK</td>
<td > A new C# example for the real-time notifications feature has been added at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-sdk-cs/src/master/REST-SDK/RealTimeNotificationExample/" class="no-ajaxy">https://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-sdk-cs/src/master/REST-SDK/RealTimeNotificationExample/</a>. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Data Broker</td>
<td > The following changes have been implemented for alarms on queue overflow:
<br>- An alarm is now also sent when the output queue is full (similar to the alarm for the input queue). 
<br>- For output queues, the alarm text will include the affected connector. 
<br>- The alarm severity has been changed from CRITICAL to MAJOR.  </td>
<td>
MTM-32280</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td > The configuration repository functionality has been enhanced. It is now possible to specify a configuration type. Moreover, the configuration repository now provides a list view, which shows the new configuration type and also allows the user to filter for configurations. If a device has the "c8y_SupportedConfigurations" fragment with a list of supported configuration types, it can have multiple configurations.<br> For details, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/device-management#configuration repository" class="no-ajaxy">Device Management > Managing device data > Configuration repository</a> in the <em>User guide</em>.  </td>
<td>
MTM-32117</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td > Dynamic groups that are in fact just managed objects with the fragment "c8y_IsDynamicGroup" can now get extended to be invisible in the UI. To do so, the "c8y_IsDynamicGroup" object within the JSON needs to look like this:<br> "c8y_IsDynamicGroup": { "invisible": {} }. If the managed object includes the fragment like this it won't be rendered within the navigator and also not in the groups' view.</td>

LWM2M</td>

<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td > LWM2M now uses the latest Microservice SDK. The agent framework has completely been removed. <br>
Verify if the firmware update object mapping exists before executing Firmware Over The Air (FOTA). If it does not exist, the operation will fail. </td>
<td>
MTM-31461</td>

<tr>
<td>
MQTT</td>
<td >  New static MQTT operation response templates have been added:
<br>- Firmware with patch (525)
<br>- Software update (528)
<br>- Configuration download with type (524)
<br>- Configuration upload with type (526)
<br>- Data profile (527) </td>

MQTT</td>
<td >  MQTT queues are purged when an MQTT device or tenant is deleted.  </td>
<td>
MTM-31469</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td > Processing mode support has been added for the OPC UA device protocol event, alarm and measurement value mappings. It is possible to define one processing mode for the device protocol and also override the processing mode for any event, alarm, measurement value mapping. If the processing mode is not defined then all the mappings will be saved in regular persistent mode.<br>
At the moment, the feature is only available via Rest API by using device protocol endpoints.<br>
Supported processing modes are PERSISTENT, TRANSIENT, QUIESCENT, CEP for measurement and event and only PERSISTENT for alarm mappings. If the given processing mode is not supported for the mapping then a warning log is given in the opcua-device-gateway logs when the device type is being applied and the default mode (PERSISTENT) is selected for those mappings. </td>
<td>
MTM-30895</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td > Updated text from "device type" to "device protocol" in auto-apply constraints fields and description. </td>
<td>
MTM-32633</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td > The OPC UA device protocol plugin implicitly sets the measurement mappings' fragment name with the user-given measurement type which makes opcua-device-gateway to use this value as the measurement fragment name instead of auto-generating the name based on the node ID. The <b>Measurement</b> tab of the device displays the fragment name as the title for the measurement. </td>
<td>
MTM-32635</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Report-agent</td>
<td > The migration of scheduled exports based on smart rules is now automatically executed while displaying a message informing the user about the process. </td>
<td>
MTM-31426</td>

<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td > The performance for API calls that require checking of inventory permissions has been improved.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > In general, every c8y-list-item can trigger a "pulse" css-animation now. This is useful when the customer needs to be notified (visually) that some changes were applied to a specific list item in a bigger list. For now, this pulse is used in the bulk operation list if the customer re-schedules a scheduled bulk operation. </td>
<td>
MTM-32543</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > In case of filtering in a dropdown search box, the label "All" will change to "All filtered". The selection of all filtered items will auto-select "All filtered" and vice-versa. If at least one but not all displayed items are selected, then "All" / "All filtered" will show indeterminate (-). </td>
