### Announcements

#### Support for Internet Explorer ending soon

In response to the announcement by Microsoft of the end of life for Internet Explorer 11, Cumulocity IoT 10.7 will be the last release that supports this browser. With upcoming releases we will continue to support the latest version of the Microsoft Edge browser as the successor to the Internet Explorer. This will allow us to continue to provide you with a state-of-the-art user experience.

#### Smart REST response codes 

The error code "40" will be removed in Cumulocity IoT 1.8 January 2021 release.  

Why are we doing this?  Currently, when connecting to Cumulocity IoT via SmartREST 1.0 you may receive an error "40", often looking like this:

	40,,/meta/connect,402::Unknown client
	86,,,0,handshake

This error means that the platform has restarted, the session has expired, or some other connectivity problem occurred. The number is misleading though, as according to the documentation "40" means "Template not found".

After the error code "40" has been removed the error will look like this:

	86,,,0,handshake


#### ngx-boostrap upgrade to 5.6.1

To fix various layout issues around tooltips and scrollbars, the ngx-bootstrap library will be upgraded to version 5.6.1. The change applies the first time to the 10.7.1 Incremental Release and to the 10.8 GA Release in January 2021. 

This change may affect developers building Cumulocity IoT UI extensions or custom web applications. It may also affect existing extensions and web applications.

An important change is the ngx-bootstrap module's import. Now, when importing a module, e.g. BsModalRef, you need to specify the exact directive to import from: 

	import { BsModalRef } from 'ngx-bootstrap/modal'; 

instead of 

	import { BsModalRef } from 'ngx-bootstrapâ€™;

For details, see the [ngx-bootstrap release notes](https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap/releases). 


### Implemented measures

#### Deprecation of breadcrumbs

[MTM-29924] Other than announced in the [Migration notes for release 10.5.7](/release-notes/10-5-7/#10-5-7-migration), the breadcrumb functionality for groups and devices has not been removed entirely. To improve performance breadcrumbs on devices and groups have been made configurable instead and are turned off by default. They can be turned on by setting the `breadcrumbs` application option, see http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/ngx-components/classes/ApplicationOptions.html#breadcrumbs.
