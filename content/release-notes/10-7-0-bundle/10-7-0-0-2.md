Device Management</td>
<td > 
The firmware and software update functionality has been enhanced. You can now manage versions for software items, and versions and patches for firmware items. Moreover, you can install multiple software items on a device, and update or remove them separately from the <b>Software</b> tab of a device. For details, see <a href="/users-guide/device-management#managing-device-data" class="no-ajaxy">Device Management > Managing device data</a> in the <em>User guide</em>. </td>

Device Management</td>
<td > The bulk operations functionality has been significantly enhanced. Details on bulk operations and their status can now be viewed in the <b>Bulk operations</b> tab on the <b>Device control</b> page. A new wizard has been implemented to add bulk operations of various types. For details, see <a href="/users-guide/device-management#working-with-operations" class="no-ajaxy">Device Management > Monitoring and controlling devices > Working with operations</a> in the <em>User guide</em>. </td>

<td>
Device Management</td>
<td > It is now possible to set up device profiles that contain a set of  firmware, software packages and configuration files. If a profile is applied to a device the respective items will be installed on the device.

Device Management</td>
<td > Cumulocity IoT allows devices to connect via MQTT protocol using a X.509 certificate for authentication. To do so, a certificate must be trusted by Cumulocity IoT. For details on how to manage trusted certificates in the UI refer to <a href="/users-guide/device-management#trusted-certificates" class="no-ajaxy">Device Management > Managing device data > Managing trusted certificates</a> in the <em>User guide</em>.

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td > A new parameter, "C8Y.lwm2mMaxRequestTimeout", has been introduced to allow the request timeout to be set at the individual device. The default value is 10 minutes. The "lwm2mRequestTimeout" specified at the device managed object and the global "C8Y.lwm2mRequestTimeout" should always be  less than the "C8Y.lwm2mMaxRequestTimeout" value. The order in which these timeouts are used is: first "lwm2mRequestTimeout" and if that is not defined then the global "lwm2mRequestTimeout" value is used. </td>

LWM2M</td>
<td > The firmware update delivery method (push/pull), the reset mechanism (write \0 to package URI vs. null to package or both), the image delivery protocol (coap/coaps/http/https) and the firmware update URL can now be configured as part of the optional fragment. </td>

<tr>
<td>
MQTT</td>

<tr>
<td>
SmartREST</td>
<td > A new MQTT static template has been added: "Set device profile that is being applied" (121), see <a href="/device-sdk/mqtt/#mqtt-static-templates" class="no-ajaxy">Device integration using MQTT > MQTT static templates</a> in the <em>Device SDK guide</em>. </td>

<td>
MTM-33061</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
UI</td>
<td > Performance has been improved by making breadcrumbs on devices and groups configurable. Per default, breadcrumbs on devices and groups are now turned off. They can be turned on by setting the <code>breadcrumbs</code> application option, see http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/ngx-components/classes/ApplicationOptions.html#breadcrumbs. All other breadcrumbs are still displayed. </td>
