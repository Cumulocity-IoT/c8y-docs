<td>
Device Management</td>
<td > It is now possible to set up device profiles that contain a set of  firmware, software packages and configuration files. If a profile is applied to a device the respective items will be installed on the device. For details, see <a href="/users-guide/device-management#managing-device-data" class="no-ajaxy">Device Management > Managing device data</a> in the User guide. </td>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td > A new parameter, "C8Y.lwm2mMaxRequestTimeout", has been introduced to allow the request timeout to be set at the individual device. The default value is 10 minutes. The "lwm2mRequestTimeout" specified at the device managed object and the global "C8Y.lwm2mRequestTimeout" should always be  less than the "C8Y.lwm2mMaxRequestTimeout" value. The order in which these timeouts are used is: first "lwm2mRequestTimeout" and if that is not defined then the global "lwm2mRequestTimeout" value is used. </td>

<td>
MQTT</td>
<td > A new parameter&nbsp; "mqtt.clientCertificate.maxChainLength" has been added to the core properties which allows to set the max length of chain of trust provided by the MQTT device. The default value is set to 2. </td>

Two-factor Authentification</td>
<td > If TFA is enforced on the system level for all users or for a single role, this information is now displayed under Administration &gt; Authentication &gt; TFA Settings. </td>

<tr>
<td>
UI</td>
<td > In the device registration wizard, the label has been changed from "LoRa" to "Actility LoRa". The label "LoRa provider settings" has been changed to "Actility LoRa provider settings". </td>

<tr>
<td>
UI</td>
<td > Performance has been improved by making breadcrumbs on devices and groups configurable. Per default, breadcrumbs on devices and groups are now turned off. The other breadcrumbs are still displayed. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td > The support user until now was not able to change another account's password because the <b>Confirm password</b> dialog would not accept the support user's current password. This issue has been fixed, and now the support user is able to change the password for another account successfully.</td>

Cockpit</td>
<td > The "Map" widget now does not display more devices than configured as default pageSize for the map ( e.g. 40). 
The "Map" widget is now able to traverse inventory until the point when it displays the full page. If it is not able to fill the page fully, a message is displayed that it has retrieved all the devices which could be found.Â </td>

<tr>
<td>
Microservices</td>
<td > By default, microservices can no longer directly call other microservices in the same Cumulocity IOT deployment. Instead, any service invocation has to be directed to the Cumulocity IoT platform APIs as described in the <em>Microservice SDK guide</em>. The sections <em>Proxy variables</em> and <em>Request routing</em> are particularly relevant in this context.</td>

<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td > The light scan process for the opcua-device-gateway's address space now skips traversing non-browsable nodes. Null checks have been improved for the internal server mappings update process.</td>

MTM-33995</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td > The OPC UA gateway now disconnects from an OPC UA server if there are too many outstanding measurements, events or alarms that have not been pushed to the platform yet. This should prevent "out of memory" issues. However, if an "out of memory" situation happens, the gateway now cleanly disconnects from the server and exits with an exit status of "1".</td>
