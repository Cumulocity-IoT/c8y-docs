<td > On the <b>Inventory roles</b> tab in the user details, the groups tree is now loaded progressively. Only the root groups are loaded. The user can click each group to expand the sub groups, or click <b>Expand all groups</b> to expand every sub group in sequence.
This change was motivated for performance reasons, improving the speed considerably in tenants with large number of groups and devices. </td>
