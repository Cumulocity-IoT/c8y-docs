Core product</td>

MTM-32206</td>

<tr>
<td>
Data Broker</td>
<td > The following changes have been implemented for alarms on queue overflow:
<br>- An alarm is now also sent when the output queue is full (similar to the alarm for the input queue). 
<br>- For output queues, the alarm text will include the affected connector. 
<br>- The alarm severity has been changed from CRITICAL to MAJOR.  </td>

MTM-32280</td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td >  The configuration repository now provides a new list view, which shows the new configuration type and also allows the user to filter for configurations.  </td>
<td>
MTM-32117</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td > Dynamic groups that are in fact just managed objects with the fragment "c8y_IsDynamicGroup" can now get extended to be invisible in the UI. To do so, the "c8y_IsDynamicGroup" object within the JSON needs to look like this:<br> "c8y_IsDynamicGroup": { "invisible": {} }. If the managed object includes the fragment like this it won't be rendered within the navigator and also not in the groups' view.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Documentation</td>
<td >  The documentation on tenant usage statistics has been improved.  </td>
<td>
MTM-32208</td>

<tr>
<td>
Documentation</td>
<td >  The Enterprise Tenant section has been updated to include the support of full chain certificates. For details, see <a href="/users-guide/enterprise-edition#customization" class="no-ajaxy">Enterprise Tenant > Customizing your platform</a> in the User guide. </td>
<td>
MTM-32145</td>

<tr>
<td>
Java SDK</td>
<td > Microservices with PER_TENANT isolation no longer periodically refresh subscriptions as this is not required.</td>
<td>
MTM-32207</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
MongoDB</td>
<td > The MongoDB configuration has been updated to avoid timeouts from MongoDB while uploading docker images. </td>
<td>
MTM-32862</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
MQTT</td>
<td >  New static MQTT operation response templates have been added:
<br>- Firmware with patch (525)
<br>- Software update (528)
<br>- Configuration download with type (524)
<br>- Configuration upload with type (526)
<br>- Data profile (527) </td>
<td>
MTM-31466</td>

<tr>
<td>
MQTT</td>
<td >  MQTT queues are purged when MQTT device or tenant is deleted.  </td>
<td>
MTM-31469</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td > Processing mode support has been added for the OPC UA device protocol event, alarm and measurement value mappings. It is possible to define one processing mode for the device protocol and also override the processing mode for any event, alarm, measurement value mapping. If the processing mode is not defined then all the mappings will be saved in regular persistent mode.<br>
At the moment, the feature is only available via Rest API by using device protocol endpoints.<br>
Supported processing modes are PERSISTENT, TRANSIENT, QUIESCENT, CEP for measurement and event and only PERSISTENT for alarm mappings. If the given processing mode is not supported for the mapping then a warning log is given in the opcua-device-gateway logs when the device type is being applied and the default mode (PERSISTENT) is selected for those mappings. </td>
<td>
MTM-30895</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td > Updated text from "device type" to "device protocol" in auto-apply constraints fields and description. </td>
<td>
MTM-32633</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td > The OPC UA device protocol plugin implicitly sets the measurement mappings' fragment name with the user-given measurement type which makes opcua-device-gateway to use this value as the measurement fragment name instead of auto-generating the name based on the node ID. The <b>Measurement</b> tab of the device displays the fragment name as the title for the measurement. </td>
<td>
MTM-32635</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Report-agent</td>
<td > The migration of scheduled exports based on smart rules is now automatically executed while displaying a message informing the user about the process. </td>
<td>
MTM-31426</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Single Sign On</td>
<td > JWKS token verification now supports all RSA public keys types. </td>
<td>
MTM-31980</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
 Various </td>
<td > Retention rule execution makes better use of the system resources, this increases performance of the retention rule execution and reduces load on the system. </td>
<td>
MTM-30785</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > In general, every c8y-list-item can trigger a "pulse" css-animation now. This is useful when the customer needs to be notified (visually) that some changes were applied to a specific list item in a bigger list. For now, this pulse is used in the bulk operation list if the customer re-schedules a scheduled bulk operation. </td>
<td>
MTM-32543</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > In case of filtering in a dropdown search box, the label "All" will change to "All filtered". The selection of all filtered items will auto-select "All filtered" and vice-versa. If at least one but not all displayed items are selected, then "All" / "All filtered" will show indeterminate (-). </td>

<tr>
<td>
Core product</td>
<td > The performance for API calls that require checking of inventory permissions has been improved. The transition through the hierarchy has been changed from the transition from-root-to-child to from-child-to-root, which prevents going through the entire hierarchy in search of a child and saving the hierarchy to memory during the search, thus reducing total memory required.</td>
