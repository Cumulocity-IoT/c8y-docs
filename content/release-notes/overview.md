These release notes document all relevant changes that have been implemented in a Cumulocity release since the previous release.

We distinguish between Private Edition releases, standard releases and maintenance releases.

#### Standard release

A standard release may provide new functionality as well as improvements and fixes to a previous release.

Standard releases have the format `<major>.<minor>`, e.g. 9.12, 9.13, 9.14. 

A standard release with general availability (GA) is a so-called Private Edition (PE) release.


#### Maintenance release

A maintenance release provides improvements and fixes to a previous release. Maintenance releases do not contain new functionality. In general, Cumulocity maintains the current and the previous PE release. 

Maintenance releases have the format `<major>.<minor>.<maintenance>`, e.g. 9.12.1, 9.12.2, 9.12.3.
