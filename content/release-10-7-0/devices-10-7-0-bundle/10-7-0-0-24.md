Device Management</td>
<td >
The firmware and software update functionality has been enhanced. You can now manage versions for software items, and versions and patches for firmware items. Moreover, you can install multiple software items on a device, and update or remove them separately from the <b>Software</b> tab of a device. For details, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.7.0/users-guide/device-management#managing-device-data" class="no-ajaxy">Device Management > Managing device data</a> in the <em>User guide</em>. </td>

<td > The bulk operations functionality has been significantly enhanced. Details on bulk operations and their status can now be viewed in the <b>Bulk operations</b> tab on the <b>Device control</b> page. A new wizard has been implemented to add bulk operations of various types.
