<td > The configuration repository functionality has been enhanced. It is now possible to specify a configuration type. Moreover, the configuration repository now provides a list view, which shows the new configuration type and also allows the user to filter for configurations. If a device has the "c8y_SupportedConfigurations" fragment with a list of supported configuration types, it can have multiple configurations.<br> For details, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.7.0/users-guide/device-management#configuration repository" class="no-ajaxy">Device Management > Managing device data > Configuration repository</a> in the <em>User guide</em>.  </td>

The "lwm2mRequestTimeout" specified at the device managed object and the global "C8Y.lwm2mRequestTimeout" should always be  less than the "C8Y.lwm2mMaxRequestTimeout" value.

It is possible to define one processing mode for the device protocol and also override the processing mode for any event, alarm, measurement value mapping. If the processing mode is not defined then all the mappings will be saved in regular persistent mode.<br>
At the moment, the feature is only available via Rest API by using device protocol endpoints.<br>
Supported processing modes are PERSISTENT, TRANSIENT, QUIESCENT, CEP for measurement and event and only PERSISTENT for alarm mappings. If the given processing mode is not supported for the mapping then a warning log is given in the opcua-device-gateway logs when the device type is being applied and the default mode (PERSISTENT) is selected for those mappings. </td>
