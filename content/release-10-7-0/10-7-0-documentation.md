[MTM-34081] Documentation has been added to the *Device SDK guide* for the Cumulocity IoT Linux Agent.

The [*Linux Agent Developer guide*](https://cumulocity.com/guides/device-sdk/linux-agent-developer-guide) contains various Lua plugin examples (Hello world, sending measurements, restart your machine, and more) for developers. 

### NEW Protocol integration guide

[MTM-29779] The documentation for the device integration protocols (like LWM2M, Sigfox and OPC UA) has been moved into a separate guide called [*Protocol integration guide*](https://cumulocity.com/guides/protocol-integration/overview) to provide a clearer structure and easier navigation.
