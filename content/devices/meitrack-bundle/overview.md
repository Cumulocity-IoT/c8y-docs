[Meitrack Group](http://www.meitrack.com/) provides GPS-based vehicle, asset and personal trackers that can be connected to Cumulocity to record coordinates and tracking information. After connecting the devices, you can create additional business logic in Cumulocity by using, for example, geofence or threshold Smart Rules.

The following data is currently recorded:

* Location, including direction, accuracy, satellites used in calculation and GPS timestamp.
* Mobile network signal strength.
* Speed and distance.
* Battery level.

The Meitrack protocol support was tested with MT90 devices. It may not apply to all Meitrack models. In particular, the battery level calculation will be only correct for devices with compatible hardware. See the [Meitrack protocol documentation](http://www.meitrack.com/en/download-center/) for more information.
