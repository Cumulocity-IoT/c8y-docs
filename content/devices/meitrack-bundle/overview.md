[Meitrack Group](http://www.meitrack.com/) provides GPS-based vehicle, asset and personal trackers that can be connected to Cumulocity to record coordinates and tracking information. After connecting the devices, you can create additional business logic in Cumulocity by using, for example, geofence or threshold Smart Rules.

The following document describes how to [configure](/guides/devices/meitrack#configuration) the Meitrack for use with Cumulocity and how to [connect](/guides/devices/meitrack#connection) it to your Cumulocity account.

>**Info**: The Meitrack protocol support was tested with MT90 devices. It may not apply to all Meitrack models. In particular, the battery level calculation will be only correct for devices with compatible hardware. See the [Meitrack protocol documentation](http://www.meitrack.com/en/download-center/) for more information.
