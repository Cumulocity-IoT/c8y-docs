[Owasys](http://www.owasys.com/) provides a ready-to-use software plugin for the open [owa3x](http://owasys.com/en/products/owa3x) platform called *pollux.cumulocity*. Once installed and configured, **this plugin provides integration with the cumulocity cloud services out of the box**.

It runs as a standalone application and it has been designed to be easily integrated with any other application developed for both the owa3x and owa3x Rugged Linux-based platforms.

This Cumulocity plugin, mantained by Owasys and made available through the [owa3x Developer's Zone](http://owasys.com/en/developers-zone/owa3x), manages connection platform registration status and measurement reporting. This functionality will be extended in future versions of the software to support native Cumulocity alarms and events, identity tracking and fully automatic registration.

If you decide to minimize time-to-market or if you do not want to develop your custom application for the open Linux [owa3x unit](http://owasys.com/en/products/owa3x/development-kit), this plugin is fully compatible with any of the other polluxfamily of plugins that Owasys provides through its developer zone.

Think of these plugins as independent building blocks that provide basic features needed for a wide range of M2M and IoT applications. From 2G/3G network service *pollux.net* to the more specific ModBus *pollux.modbus* plugin, Owasys is continuously working on improving and adding new features to this range of software building blocks. Please, do not hesitate to access our [Developer's Zone](http://owasys.com/en/developers-zone/owa3x) or [contact our customer support service](http://owasys.com/en/contact) should you require further information about available *pollux* plugins.
