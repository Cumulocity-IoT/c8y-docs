The LoRaWAN by ADEUNIS RF demonstrator is a ready-to-use system, which provides connection to any operated network using the LoRaWAN protocol. 

With 3 integrated sensors (GPS, accelerometer, temperature) this demonstrator allows to transmit and instantly view the radio frames on the compatible networks. 

This demonstrator is particularly suitable for the validation of applications like sensor networks, environment, intelligent buildings, metering, security, or M2M. These applications can thus be validated on-site before the deployment of infrastructure.
