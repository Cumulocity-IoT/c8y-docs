The router reports certain system events as notifications, which can be forwarded to Cumulocity as alarms. The system events help, for example, in troubleshooting mobile network issues. For more information on the different types of events and how to forward them, please consult the Netcomm documentation (for example, Section "Event notification" in the user's guide). To forward an event as alarm, set up a UDP destination sending to Port 1331 on localhost (Section "Destination configuration").
