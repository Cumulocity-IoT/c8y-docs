The [INSYS icom](http://www.insys-icom.com/) industrial routers and fault monitors with INSYS OS support automatic data transmission from monitored PLCs or other devices to the Cumulocity Cloud. This is realised by the [Monitoring App](http://www.insys-icom.com/monitoring-app), an addition to the standard INSYS OS firmware. The app allows an easy and efficient monitoring of Siemens LOGO!â„¢ and S7 controls as well as Modbus TCP/RTU devices or the I/Os of an INSYS IMON fault monitor. Measurement values, conditions, events and alarms can be transmitted to the Cumulocity Cloud. All available data can be setup directly in the Monitoring App and are automatically provided to the cloud account for (automatically self-scaling) charts and lists. Several PLCs can be monitored in parallel with one INSYS Smart Device. The transmission of data to several cloud accounts is also possible If the cloud service or transmission path is (temporarily) not available, data can be buffered on the INSYS Smart Device or transmitted via redundant transmission paths in the meantime. Cloud Control enables the modification of parameters of the INSYS Smart Device from the cloud service.

The following INSYS OS Smart Devices support Cumulocity (Monitoring App 2.5.2 or higher must be installed):

* [IMON series](http://insys-icom.com/IMON): Condition Monitors
* [EBW series](http://insys-icom.com/EBW): Basic Industrial Routers
* [MoRoS series](http://insys-icom.com/MoRoS): All-round Industrial Routers
