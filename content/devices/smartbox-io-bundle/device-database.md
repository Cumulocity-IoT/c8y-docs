All devices which are connected to the SMARTbox are needed to define in Device Database. The definition includes all supported datapoints of this connected device. Even more, you can not only define the "physical datapoint" like register address, you can also define if this datapoint comes in the cloud as a measurement, event, alarm or write value. In addition some control field per datapoint are available which includes metadata like the Unit or Display Category.
