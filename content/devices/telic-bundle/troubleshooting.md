Here are some general hints if your tracking device does not connect to Cumulocity or shows incorrect data:

* Make sure that the LED indicators on the device indicate both a working GPS and a working network connection.
* Devices can only registered after they start sending data to Cumulocity.
* Devices may send the location of the last GPS fix if there is no GPS reception.
* The "Location" and "Tracking" tabs appear only in the user interface when the first GPS coordinate has been received.
* The agent currently supports the 100μ° and the 1μ°resolution data format.
