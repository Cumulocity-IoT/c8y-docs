[Queclink](http://www.queclink.com/product) offers GPS-enabled devices with diverse form factors, battery lifetimes and connectors. The following devices have been tested with Cumulocity and are known to report their location in a format that Cumulocity understands:

* GL200 Multi-Function Mini Asset Tracker
* GL300 Advanced Asset Tracker
* GL500 Hibernating Asset Tracking Device
* GL505 Waterproof Hibernating Asset Tracking Device
* GV200 Full Featured Vehicle Tracker
* GV300 Advanced Vehicle Tracking Device
* GV500 OBD Vehicle Tracking Device
* GV75 Waterproof Advanced Vehicle Tracking Device

The location and traces of the equipped assets are shown in Cumulocity and you can create additional business logic on top of the data (for example, sending an email when a geofence is left). For the GL200, device-side motion tracking and geofencing can be configured from Cumulocity.
