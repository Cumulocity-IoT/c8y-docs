[TinkerForge](http://tinkerforge.com) provides generic sensors and controls for diverse use cases ranging from environmental monitoring to industrial automation. Together with Cumulocity, you can

* Build complete machine-to-machine use cases by just plugging off-the-shelf hardware components together. No configuration is required -- the components are automatically discovered by the Cumulocity Java agent and connected to the cloud.
* Instantly visualize sensor data and remote control devices in real-time.
