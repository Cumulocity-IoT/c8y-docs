Meshlium works as a gateway, receiving sensor measurements from all the Waspmotes connected to it, then sending those measurements to Cumulocity.

The following document demonstrates how to use a Meshlium device with Cumulocity. It describes how to

* [Configure](/guides/devices/libelium-meshlium#configuration) Meshlium for use.
* [Connect](/guides/devices/libelium-meshlium#connection) your Meshlium to your Cumulocity account.
* [Data visualization](/guides/devices/libelium-meshlium#data) and table configuration at Cumulocity.

>**Info**: Meshlium Firmware version 3.2.7 or higher is required to connect to the Cumulocity IoT platform. In case you cannot find Cumulocity in the Meshlium Manager System, you will need to update your device.
