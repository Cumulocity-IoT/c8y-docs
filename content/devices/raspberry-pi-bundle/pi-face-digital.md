The agent includes a simple [PiFace Digital](http://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-52857/l/piface-digital-for-raspberry-pi) driver. The driver will create events when switches are pressed and will react to remote control commands to the relays. The events can be further processed through [CEP rules](/guides/concepts/realtime).

Before using your PiFace Digital make sure you have tested it following the instructions on the [official website](http://www.piface.org.uk/guides/Install_PiFace_Software/). You don't have to go through the whole guide. Following it up to the "Testing your PiFace" part is enough.
