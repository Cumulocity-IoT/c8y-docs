You need to register the INSYS Smart Device in your Cumulocity Cloud account first. The self-registration functionality of Cumulocity uses the serial number of the INSYS Smart Device as unique identifier. The serial number is indicated on the device label and can also be displayed in the System menu on the System data page in the web interface of the INSYS Smart Device.
