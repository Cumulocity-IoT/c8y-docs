Gemalto offers a number of Java-enabled M2M modules as part of their [Cinterion product line](http://m2m.gemalto.com/products.html). These modules combine modem functionality, hardware interfaces (such as serial, GPIO, ...) and a programmable platform based on JavaME. In this section, we describe how to use a Cinterion Java module with the Cumulocity JavaME client libraries.

### Prerequisites

To run the example in this section, you need to:

* A Cinterion Java module with an activated SIM card.
* A Microsoft Windows environment with the Cinterion Mobility Toolkit (CMTK) installed. The CMTK software and documentation is available from your local Cinterion distributor.
* Eclipse integrated with the CMTK as described in Cinterion's Java User's Guide.
* A working connection between your Windows environment and your Cinterion Java module through USB or serial interfaces.
