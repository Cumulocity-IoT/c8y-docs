Devices can raise alarms to indicate that there is a problem requiring an intervention.

### To view alarms {#to-view-alarms}

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} displays alarms at the level of individual devices and across all devices:

* To check the alarms for all devices, click **Alarms** in the **Overview** menu in the navigator.
* To check the alarms of a particular device, switch to the **Alarms** tab in the details of this device.

![Alarms page](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-alarms-view.png)

By default,

* only unresolved alarms are shown. If you turn on **Show cleared alarms** in the **Filter alarms** dropdown menu at the top, you will see the entire alarm history.
* The alarms list is automatically refreshed every 30 seconds. Click **Disable auto-refresh** to stop the alarms list from refreshing automatically.

Alarms are classified according to their severity. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} includes four different alarm types:

|Severity|Description|
|:---|:--|
|CRITICAL|The device is out of service and should be fixed immediately.
|MAJOR|The device has a problem that should be fixed.
|MINOR|The device has a problem that may be fixed.
|WARNING|There is a warning.


In the top menu bar, a **Filter Alarms** button is provided to filter by severity. By clicking a filter button, you can check or uncheck severities that you want to show or hide, and after that, click **Apply**.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The number provided in the filter menu refers to the number of active alarms for the given severity, as opposed to the counter provided as blue circle next to an active alarm, which shows the number of times this same alarm has occurred (see also the table below).
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

Within the **Alarms list**, the alarms are sorted by their occurrence, displaying the most recent alarm first.

In the **Alarms list**, the following information for an alarm is provided:

<table>
<thead>
<colgroup>
   <col style="width: 20%;">
   <col style="width: 80%;">
</colgroup>
<tr>
<th align="left">Info</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">Severity</td>
<td align="left">One of CRITICAL, MAJOR, MINOR, WARNING (see above).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Count (provided as number in a blue circle) </td>
<td align="left">The number of times this alarm was sent by the device. Only one alarm of a particular type can be active for a certain device. If another alarm of the same type is sent by the device, the number is increased by 1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Description</td>
<td align="left">An arbitrary text describing the alarm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Status</td>
<td align="left">The status of the alarm. An alarm can be: <br> <strong>Active</strong>: When it was raised and nobody is so far working on the alarm. <br><strong>Acknowledged</strong>: When someone changed the status to "Acknowledged" to indicate that someone is working on the alarm.<br><strong>Cleared</strong>: When either someone manually set the status to "clear" or when the device detected by itself that the problem has gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Last occurrence</td>
<td align="left">Timestamp of the last occurrence of the alarm (device time).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Device</td>
<td align="left">The name of the device.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Select an alarm by clicking on the alarm in the **Alarms list** that you are interested in, to display further details about the alarm.

* **First Occurrence**: Provides information about when the alarm first occurred.
