Devices can be grouped according to a particular use case. A device can be located in multiple groups and groups themselves can again be part of multiple groups.

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} distinguishes between top-level groups and subgroups:

* **Top-level groups** are shown in the **Group** menu in the navigator at top-level.
* **Subgroups** can be used to further subdivide top-level groups.
