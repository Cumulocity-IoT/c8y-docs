{{< product-c8y-iot >}} can associate devices and assets with multiple external identities. For example, devices can often be identified by the IMEI of their modem, by a micro-controller serial number or by an asset tag. The **Identity** tab lists all the identities recorded for a particular device.

This is useful, for example, when you have non-functional hardware and must replace the hardware without losing the data that was recorded. Just connect the new hardware to your account and modify the identity entry of the old hardware, to contain the identity of the new hardware.
