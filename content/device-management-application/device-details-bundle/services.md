The **Services tab** provides a list of all services running on a device with their status, name, type and date of the last update.
Every column allows services to be filtered and/or sorted by the respective value displayed.

The platform defines three status options for services: **Up**, **Down** and **Unknown**.
These predefined statuses have their own graphical representation and can be selected directly from the **Status** filter. Other status options are also allowed and can be freely defined, see [Service module](http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/ngx-components/modules/ServicesModule.html#readme) in the Web SDK documentation resources.
They all share the same icon and must be entered manually in the **Status** filter.
A tooltip on the status icon displays their actual value.
