The **Location** tab by default shows the location of a device on a map and as coordinates, as reported by the device. For devices that do not report a location you may manually set the location. Simply place the "pin" in the correct place of the displayed map.

The **Location** tab also shows when a device contains `c8y_Position` property. When you send a new `c8y_Position` event, you can set the same `c8y_Position` fragment on the device and it will automatically mark its position on the map.
