REST API </td>
<td > The Inventory API has been improved with a new "hasany()" function which  accepts multiple parameters. This means that it is possible to use a single statement rather than multiple 'has()" functions joined with OR statements. For example: /inventory/managedObjects?query=$filter=hasany(c8y_IsDynamicGroup, c8y_Status) </td>
